Specifically:

Remove stock tickers, price info, and performance data.

Remove author names, and metadata like “in this article.”

Delete any footers like “read more,” “contact us,” “send tips,” “take our survey,” etc.

Retain all body text, quotes, structure, and paragraphing exactly as in the original article, and the updated time as well.
The final output should look like a clean, fully preserved article, free of external noise but with all reporting, testimony, and story details intact.
