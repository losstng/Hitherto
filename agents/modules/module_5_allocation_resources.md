# Module 5 – Allocation of Resources (Capital & Compute)

## Role
Optimizes portfolio weights and computational focus given expected returns, risk budgets, and research priorities.

## Version 1: Autonomous
- Runs CVaR-constrained optimization with risk-parity checks.
- Adjusts risk budgets and compute allocation via bandit algorithms.
- Outputs target portfolio weights and task schedules.

## Version 2: Human–AI Hybrid
- AI proposes allocations; portfolio managers apply strategic overlays.
- Humans weigh turnover costs, mandates, and research priorities.
- Final allocation reflects both quantitative output and human directives.
