# **Implementing the Hitherto Market Operating Doctrine: Two Action Plan Versions**

The following are two comprehensive **action plans** for executing and integrating the multi-module *Hitherto Market Operating Doctrine*. Both plans focus on **strategy and implementation** rather than specific coding or language details. Each covers all doctrine components (Modules 0–13 and supporting systems), emphasizing *how* to build and integrate them into a cohesive, state-of-the-art trading intelligence system. Plan **Version 1** outlines a fully **autonomous, modular AI-driven architecture**, while Plan **Version 2** describes a **hybrid human–AI approach**. Both are designed to leverage **world-class methods** and ensure the **LLM-based agents are autonomous and self-learning**, with human insight incorporated where appropriate.

## **Version 1: Autonomous Multi-Agent System (Modular AI-Driven Implementation)**

**Overview:** Version 1 implements each doctrine module as a specialized **AI/ML component or agent** operating under a central **Overseer**. The focus is on a *modular multi-agent architecture* where each component (risk, sentiment, etc.) uses state-of-the-art quantitative and AI techniques. The modules communicate via **structured data contracts** (JSON signals/proposals) to ensure clarity and minimal context loss, and an autonomous overseer fuses their outputs into decisions. Rigorous **guardrails** and **evaluation metrics** are built in to ensure safety and continuous improvement. This plan aims for maximum automation: the system self-adjusts to new data and regimes with minimal human intervention, reflecting the latest research showing that multi-agent LLM frameworks can outperform traditional strategies[tradingagents-ai.github.io](https://tradingagents-ai.github.io/#:~:text=We%20presented%20TradingAgents%2C%20a%20multi,processing%20to%20further%20improve%20performance).

### **0\. Command & Control (Overseer \+ Regimes) – *Central Orchestration & Regime Management***

**Mandate:** Design an **Overseer agent** that selects the active strategy playbook based on market regime, allocates trust/weight to different module outputs, and vetoes any action violating risk limits. This is the *command center* of the system.

* **Regime Classification:** Implement a regime detection model to feed the Overseer. Use **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** or **Bayesian change-point detection** on volatility, liquidity, and correlation features to classify market regime (e.g. bull, bear, high-vol, low-vol). Include hysteresis (e.g. require a regime to persist for N periods before switching) to avoid flip-flop in regime signals. Periodically retrain or update the regime model with new data, using **Bayes factors** or likelihood scores to update regime beliefs as new information arrives.

* **Dynamic Playbook Selection:** For each identified regime, pre-define a *playbook* (a set of strategy parameter settings or module weightings). For example, in a *“low-vol carry”* regime the Overseer might emphasize carry and fundamental signals, whereas in a *“high-vol crisis”* regime it might emphasize risk-off signals and hedging. Encode these mappings so the Overseer can **automatically switch** model weights and decision rules when a regime shift is confirmed. Enforce a **minimum dwell time** in each regime (no rapid oscillation) to prevent chattering.

* **Signal Fusion & Decision Making:** The Overseer listens to all signal outputs from modules (sentiment, fundamentals, technical, etc.). Build a **fusion algorithm** (e.g. an entropy-weighted ensemble or Bayesian model averaging) that combines these signals into a unified **policy proposal**. For instance, use **entropy pooling** to weight model outputs under constraints (ensuring the combined view remains within sensible bounds). The Overseer should allocate higher trust to modules that historically perform well in the current regime (dynamic weighting).

* **Risk Override (Veto Power):** Integrate the Overseer with the Risk Management module (Module 1\) such that any proposed action must pass a risk check. If the risk module flags a violation (e.g. exceeding VaR or limit), the Overseer must **downgrade or veto** the action. In practice, every proposed **Policy** (see *Integration* below) carries metadata of checked constraints, and the Overseer only greenlights those marked safe by Risk. This implements a “two-key” rule – the Overseer and Risk must jointly approve significant actions.

* **Outputs:** The Overseer issues a **final policy decision** (target asset, position size change `delta_exposure`, and timing) only after reconciling inputs and applying vetoes. This decision is then handed off to execution (Module 6). The Overseer also logs rationale (which signals influenced it) for transparency.

**How to Execute:** Develop the regime classifier first using historical data labeled by known market conditions. Then build the Overseer logic to query all modules’ outputs (via a shared data bus or API) and apply weighting rules per regime. Implement a **policy aggregator** function that merges signals into one action proposal (for example, a weighted sum of recommended exposures or a voting system). Integrate a check where before finalizing, the proposal calls a risk evaluation function (Module 1\) – if risk returns “REJECTED” or “DOWNGRADED”, the Overseer must adjust or cancel the trade. This central loop runs at a set frequency (e.g. every hour or day) or on event triggers, continually monitoring regime indicators and module outputs.

### **1\. Risk Management (Supreme Court) – *Pre-Trade Risk Checks & Limits Enforcement***

**Mandate:** Establish a **risk engine** that defines the *feasible set* of actions at any time and **polices all trades**. It must measure portfolio risk (exposure, VaR, drawdown) in real time and enforce hard constraints before any trade is executed.

* **Risk Metrics & Models:** Implement calculation of **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** at 99% and **Expected Shortfall (CVaR)** at 97% (or appropriate levels) for the portfolio. Use a moving window of returns and a method like **Historical Simulation** or **Monte Carlo with fat-tail modeling** (e.g. using **extreme value theory** to better estimate tail risk). Continuously update these risk metrics as positions change. Additionally, track **drawdown** from peak equity to enforce a max drawdown limit (e.g. if drawdown exceeds 12%, trigger risk-off actions).

* **Optimization under Constraints:** Incorporate **Kelly criterion** sizing guidelines to maximize growth but cap variance – for instance, compute the ideal Kelly fraction of capital for a trade but impose a volatility cap so position sizes remain within volatility tolerance. Also apply **drawdown-constrained optimization**: if recent losses mount, automatically scale back new position sizes (adaptive risk budgeting).

* **Hard Limits & Guardrails:** Define static limits in a config: e.g. max gross exposure 1.8× equity, net exposure 0.6×, per-name (single asset) exposure ≤5% NAV, sector exposure caps, and leverage limits by tier. Code these as absolute checks. If any proposed trade causes a breach, flag it. Also include a **“kill-switch”** mechanism: if certain thresholds are breached (e.g. portfolio loss beyond a daily limit or liquidity crisis detected), the system halts new trades and possibly reduces positions to cut risk (circuit-breaker logic).

* **Outputs:** The risk module should output a **risk verdict** for every proposed action: e.g. `{"target": "VNINDEX", "status": "APPROVED", "reason": null}` or if rejected: `"status": "REJECTED", "reason": "ES_breach"` etc. It also continuously publishes the current **risk state** (VaR, ES, drawdown, etc.) and **limit utilization** to other modules. If status is “TIGHTEN” (perhaps when conditions are risky but not halt), the Overseer/Execution can adapt by reducing position sizes or requiring higher confidence.

* **Integration:** Make the risk engine the *first* to evaluate any policy proposal (before execution). The risk check should be a fast computation or rule evaluation that runs synchronously when the Overseer forms a proposal. Also feed risk metrics into other modules – e.g. the RL agent (Module 8\) might adjust its reward if risk is high, and the allocation module (5) uses risk budgets in optimization.

**How to Execute:** Develop a **risk management service** that subscribes to portfolio updates and proposed trades. Use libraries or custom code to calculate VaR/ES (e.g. Python’s pandas for historical simulation, or a analytical VaR model). Set up a database or in-memory store for current positions and their risk parameters (beta, volatility, etc.). Implement a **limit-check function** that takes a candidate portfolio (current \+ proposed trade) and returns PASS/FAIL for each limit. Integrate this service by calling it from the Overseer’s decision logic – e.g. `if risk_check(trade) != PASS: veto`. Also schedule this service to run independently at end of day to rebalance or reduce exposure if any **overnight risk limits** are hit. Ensure this module is thoroughly tested with extreme scenarios (e.g. sudden crash) to verify the kill-switch triggers appropriately.

### **2\. Sentiment Analysis (Narrative Field) – *Crowd Mood & Narrative Signal Extraction***

**Mandate:** Quantify market sentiment and narrative pressure from news, social media, and other textual data, separating genuine signal from hype. Provide measures of euphoria, fear, and the *narrative tone* around assets or sectors.

* **Data Ingestion:** Set up feeds for relevant textual data: financial news articles, social media posts (Twitter, forums), and possibly transcripts or reports. Use an LLM or NLP pipeline to parse these in near-real-time. Apply **provenance filtering** – e.g. categorize sources by tier (top-tier news vs random social posts) and possibly discard low-credibility or bot-like sources to reduce noise.

* **Transformer-Based Sentiment Scoring:** Fine-tune a **Transformer language model** (such as a finance-specific BERT or GPT variant) to output sentiment polarity and intensity scores for any given text. This model should produce a **sentiment score** (e.g. –1 to \+1) and an intensity/confidence level. It can also classify narratives by topic (e.g. assign topics like “Fed policy” or “Tech earnings” to each news piece) and detect *surprise* level (how unusual is the news vs expectations). Leverage techniques like zero-shot stance detection or few-shot classification using the LLM if fine-tuning data is limited.

* **Narrative Indicators:** Implement specialized metrics: e.g. **narrative contagion index** using **Hawkes processes** – model the rate at which a news theme (say “recession fears”) triggers follow-up articles or posts, indicating viral spread. Also compute **topic persistence half-life** (how long a story stays in public attention) by measuring decay of mentions over time. Another metric: **transfer entropy** from sentiment to price – essentially measure if changes in sentiment precede price/volume changes for certain assets, to identify sentiment-leading signals.

* **Outputs:** For each entity (stock, index, sector) of interest, emit a **sentiment signal object** periodically (e.g. hourly or daily). This could be JSON with fields: `entity`, sentiment score, confidence, dominant narrative topic, surprise level, and perhaps a short rationale (e.g. key phrase that drove the score). Also maintain aggregate indices like a **market euphoria index** or **fear gauge** (similar to VIX but from text) by aggregating across narratives. Flag extreme conditions (e.g. euphoric bubble narrative or panic) as special alerts to the Overseer.

* **Failure Mode Mitigation:** To avoid bias or manipulation: incorporate a **de-duplication and bot-filter**. E.g. if 100 bot accounts repeat the same news, count it once. If source is known biased, down-weight its influence. The sentiment model should primarily focus on factual tone (positive/negative news) to avoid getting fooled by hype cycles. Periodically retrain the sentiment model on new data (with true price impacts as part of labeling, if possible) so it “learns” which narratives truly moved markets versus which were noise.

**How to Execute:** Begin with a **pre-trained financial sentiment model** (such as FinBERT) and refine it on your data (news articles labeled with market reaction). Set up an ETL pipeline for news: e.g. RSS feeds or APIs for news, Twitter API for tweets. Use NLP preprocessing to clean text (remove irrelevant info, identify company tickers mentioned). Feed text into the transformer model to get sentiment outputs. Implement additional scripts for Hawkes process modeling – e.g. use a library or write a likelihood estimation to detect self-exciting patterns in the timing of related news articles. Integrate the sentiment module by having it publish its signals to a message bus or database that the Overseer and other modules can read. Ensure a **feedback loop**: after major events, check how sentiment signals correlated with actual price moves, and adjust the model or scaling of signals accordingly (this is part of continuous improvement).

### **3\. Fundamentals Analysis (Anchor) – *Intrinsic Value & Quality Modeling***

**Mandate:** Provide an “intrinsic value anchor” for each asset and filter out low-quality opportunities. This module analyzes fundamental data (financial statements, ratios, growth metrics, alternative data on business performance) to produce fair value estimates and quality scores.

* **Factor Models & Quality Scores:** Construct a **multi-factor model** that includes value factors (e.g. P/E, P/B ratios relative to peers), quality factors (profit margins, ROE, debt levels), growth indicators (revenue/earnings growth rates), and perhaps momentum of fundamentals. Use cross-sectional ranking or z-scores to compare stocks on these factors. Apply **Bayesian shrinkage** to extreme accounting numbers – e.g. if a company’s metric is an outlier, temper it toward industry mean to account for likely noise or one-off effects.

* **Fair Value Estimation:** Implement a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** model or an earnings yield model for each stock to estimate fair value distribution. Instead of point estimates, use *distributional inputs*: generate several scenarios (bull/base/bear cases for growth, margins, etc.) and discount rates, then compute a distribution of fair value. This provides a range or confidence interval for intrinsic value. Alternatively, use an **automated fundamental analysis LLM**: supply it with a company’s latest financials and guidance, and let it output an “implied fair value range” or a relative valuation (though ensure this is grounded in data, possibly by fine-tuning the LLM on historical fundamentals and outcomes).

* **Alt-Data Nowcasting:** Integrate alternative data (Module 11\) to adjust fundamentals in near-real-time. For example, use satellite traffic data or web analytics to nowcast current quarter revenues. If the alt-data indicates sales way above trend, the fundamentals module can adjust the fair value upward ahead of official earnings. Implement a small **nowcasting model** that maps specific alt metrics to financial outcomes (trained on historical instances).

* **Outputs:** For each asset, output a **fair value band** (e.g. undervalued \< $X, fair range $Y–$Z, overvalued \> $W) along with a **mispricing score** that indicates how far current price is from mid-fair value (in % or std deviations). Also provide **factor exposures** (like a vector of factor z-scores) to explain the drivers. Include an **uncertainty estimate** (wider bands if the inputs are noisy or if scenarios diverge). The module might also output a **“fundamental anchor signal”** – e.g. \+1 if stock deeply undervalued (buy), –1 if overvalued (sell), 0 if fairly priced – possibly with magnitude scaled by conviction.

* **Integration:** The Overseer can use the mispricing score as a key input (e.g. a high conviction undervaluation signal might prompt increasing exposure if confirmed by technical momentum). Also, risk management can use factor exposures from fundamentals to ensure, for instance, not all positions load on the same factor (diversification).

**How to Execute:** Set up a **fundamentals database** that pulls financial statement data, analyst consensus, etc. You can use financial APIs or feeds for quarterly results. Code the factor calculations and update them every time new data comes in. For DCF, codify assumptions for each scenario or use an automated tool (some libraries can estimate DCF given inputs). If using an LLM to assist, fine-tune it on historical data where the output is known fair value range (though this is challenging – an alternative is to use it qualitatively for rationale). Backtest the fundamental signals: check if high mispricing score historically led to future corrections. Use those results to calibrate the thresholds for what is a significant signal. In integration, perhaps only act on fundamental signals when they are extreme or when multiple other modules agree, to avoid value traps (cheap for a reason).

### **4\. Technical Analysis (Path Geometry) – *Trend, Mean Reversion & Microstructure Signals***

**Mandate:** Analyze price and volume patterns to characterize the market’s path (trend vs reversal, volatility regimes, microstructure hints) and identify timing signals or warning signs from market behavior itself.

* **Trend and Momentum Filters:** Implement adaptive trend indicators such as **Kaufman’s Adaptive Moving Average (KAMA)** or an advanced momentum filter (e.g. an **Angularity Detection Line** if using ADL variants). These adapt to volatility, providing smoother signals with less lag. Also use classic indicators like **moving average crossovers**, **RSI**, **MACD**, but calibrate them per regime (e.g. momentum thresholds might differ in trending vs range-bound regimes). Use cross-regime validation to ensure an indicator isn’t overfit: test that it still has predictive value in multiple market conditions.

* **Volatility Clustering & Breakout Detection:** Deploy a **GARCH model** (e.g. GARCH(1,1)) to estimate current volatility and forecast near-term volatility – this helps know if the market is in a calm or turbulent state. Implement a **state-dependent breakout detector**: for instance, a volatility-adjusted Bollinger Band – if price moves outside a band scaled to current vol, signal a potential breakout. Conversely, detect mean-reversion cues with tools like ADF tests for stationarity on recent price series or a simple “price snapback” after extreme moves.

* **Market Microstructure Signals:** Calculate metrics like **VPIN (Volume-synchronized Probability of Informed Trading)** which uses order flow imbalance to gauge stress in liquidity – a high VPIN could warn of impending volatility jumps (as informed traders may be active). Also track **order book imbalance** (if accessible) or intraday volume spikes, which could indicate either accumulation or distribution by large players. A sudden drying of liquidity (widening spreads, low volume) should raise a flag in the technical module to caution the execution strategy (e.g. trade slower).

* **Outputs:** The technical module outputs **path labels** or regimes (e.g. “strong uptrend”, “choppy”, “volatile downtrend”, “range-bound”) with a confidence, **momentum scores** (maybe standardized 0–1 for bullish momentum vs bearish), and **breakout alerts** (signal \= \+1 for upside breakout, –1 for breakdown, 0 for none, with confidence). It also can produce **liquidity warnings** if microstructure metrics indicate poor conditions (e.g. output a boolean flag or risk factor for liquidity). Additionally, provide **timing windows** for execution – e.g. if a breakout is likely, the system may want to enter sooner; if mean reversion likely, maybe wait for a better price.

* **Integration:** Technical signals often drive short-term timing: The Overseer can use a strong technical breakout signal to time entry/exit (provided fundamentals/sentiment agree on direction). Technical’s volatility estimate can feed into risk (for VaR calculation) and into the RL policy (Module 8, which might perform different actions under high vs low volatility). The execution module (6) should consume liquidity and microstructure cues (e.g. if liquidity is thin, it might slice orders more slowly, or avoid market orders).

**How to Execute:** Use a combination of **Python quant libraries** (like TA-Lib or custom code) for indicators and statistical tests for mean reversion detection. Continuously feed in live price/volume data (at least daily, possibly intraday for microstructure metrics). For VPIN, implement the algorithm that batches volume into constant units and measures order imbalance. This might require real-time data – consider using a data vendor API for intraday order flow if available. Calibrate indicator signals by analyzing historical performance: e.g. did RSI\<30 (oversold) lead to bounce, etc. Include those findings in deciding which technical signals are reliable. The technical module can run in parallel, updating its signals frequently (in an internal state store or by publishing messages). Ensure to **contextualize technical signals with regime info**: e.g. use the regime from Module 0 to adjust interpretation (a “breakout” in a high-vol regime might be noise, but in a low-vol regime could be significant). Testing should include *walk-forward simulation* to ensure these signals contribute positive performance when combined with others (avoid overfitting any single pattern).

### **5\. Allocation of Resources (Capital & Compute) – *Portfolio Capital Allocation & Compute Scheduling***

**Mandate:** Allocate trading capital across opportunities and allocate computational resources/attention to where it’s most effective. Ensure the portfolio reflects the best risk-adjusted bets and that the system’s compute is focused on what matters.

* **Portfolio Optimization:** Implement a **robust mean-variance optimizer** that works within the risk constraints (from Module 1). Instead of a naive mean-variance, use **CVaR-constrained optimization** – maximize expected return for a given CVaR limit (to incorporate tail risk). Include **turnover penalties** so the allocation doesn’t shift too radically day-to-day (to reduce transaction costs). The optimizer should take as input the expected return for each asset (which could be derived from the combination of signals: sentiment, fundamentals, technicals can be translated into an expected return or alpha forecast) and the risk (volatility, correlation). Solve for the optimal weights subject to limits (perhaps using quadratic programming or Monte Carlo simulations if including non-linear constraints). This yields a suggested portfolio allocation.

* **Risk Parity & Budgeting:** As a sanity check or alternative approach, implement **risk parity** allocation where capital is allocated so that each asset or strategy contributes equally to risk. This can run in parallel and the Overseer can blend between mean-variance and risk-parity results depending on market conditions (risk-parity might dominate in highly uncertain environments). Also dynamically allocate **risk budgets**: e.g. if the sentiment and fundamentals align strongly on one stock, you might allocate a larger budget to it (but capped by risk limits).

* **Compute/Research Allocation:** Use a multi-armed **bandit algorithm** to allocate computational resources to research strategies. For example, if you have numerous alternative signals or model variants being tested, allocate more simulation time or data to those showing promise. This can also apply to data gathering (which alt-data sources to poll more frequently) or even which **LLM agent to call with higher frequency**. The bandit can treat each source/model as an “arm” with a reward (information gain or performance improvement) – allocating attention to maximize overall system learning.

* **Outputs:** The output is primarily a **capital allocation plan** – e.g. desired portfolio weights for each asset or strategy. This can be represented as a vector that the Execution module will aim to achieve (subject to trading frictions). It may also output a **compute task schedule**: for instance, a list of processes or models to run more or less frequently (perhaps logged, or used internally by the platform to prioritize tasks).

* **Integration:** The allocation module sits between idea generation and execution – it takes inputs from signal modules (expected returns or scores) and from risk (allowed limits), and produces target positions which then feed into Execution (6) as the goal. It should closely integrate with Risk (never output weights that violate limits) and with the Overseer (the Overseer might tweak allocation outcomes if, say, a certain sector exposure is against a high-level view). If compute allocation is included, it functions in the background, informing developers or the system which models or data to emphasize in future (essentially improving the system’s evolution).

**How to Execute:** Build a **portfolio optimizer** using tools like cvxpy (for convex optimization) or simulate various allocations to estimate CVaR and returns. Start with a simpler mean-variance under constraints to get a baseline, then layer in CVaR by generating scenarios (via Monte Carlo or historical resampling) to estimate tail risk for each candidate allocation. Use those to eliminate allocations that breach ES limits. The result can be a target weight for each asset. The compute allocation aspect might involve logging performance of each model or signal (e.g. how often did sentiment signals lead to profitable trades) and then using a Bayesian bandit or simple heuristic to say “focus more on X”. This can be implemented as a periodic review process: e.g. every week, evaluate which signals added value and adjust an internal schedule or weighting for how often to run/refresh those signals. Automating this fully can be complex, so initially it could be run offline and then gradually integrated into the system’s self-learning loop.

### **6\. Equity (Position) Management (Execution Law) – *Trade Execution & Position Control***

**Mandate:** Execute trades to implement the target positions while minimizing market impact and respecting liquidity and risk. Manage the lifecycle of positions (entry, sizing, adjustment, exit) in a way that achieves the intended exposure with minimal slippage.

* **Optimal Trade Sizing:** Given a desired position size from the allocation module, determine the **trade schedule**. Use the **Almgren-Chriss optimal execution framework** (or similar) to split a large order into smaller slices over time. This minimizes impact by balancing market impact cost vs. opportunity cost. Input parameters include liquidity (average daily volume, ADV, etc.), volatility, and risk aversion level. The result will be, say, a plan to buy X shares per time interval or a **TWAP/VWAP schedule** if minimal market impact is desired.

* **Inventory/Risk Controls:** Implement **inventory control rules**: e.g. do not accumulate more than a certain percentage of daily volume (to avoid undue impact; often a rule like “never trade more than 10–20% of ADV”). If shorting, check **borrow availability**; if a stock is hard-to-borrow (HTB) or expensive to short, flag or adjust the position size down. Incorporate **beta and sector hedging**: if a position will create an outsized exposure (say all tech stocks long), the execution module might automatically include a short index future or sector ETF to hedge the beta/sector risk, if that’s part of the strategy.

* **Adaptive Execution Strategies:** Depending on real-time conditions, adjust execution: e.g. if during a buy order the price starts spiking (sign of low liquidity or others buying), possibly **throttle down** (pause or slice even smaller) to avoid pushing the price too much. Conversely, if a price is dropping while you’re buying (favorable), you might speed up to catch the lower prices. Use **real-time data** to adapt: order book info if available (to avoid walking the book), or simple feedback loops (if slippage exceeds a threshold, slow down).

* **Outputs:** The execution module issues **child orders** to the market (could interface with a broker API). These orders might be marketable limit orders set to achieve an average price. It also outputs **execution reports** – e.g. filled quantity, average price, slippage vs benchmark – to be fed back into the system for learning. Additionally, it can output **hedge transactions** (like short futures, if implemented) as part of the overall execution package.

* **Integration:** Execution must honor the risk constraints at every step: e.g. if mid-execution a risk limit is hit (vol spikes making projected VaR too high), it should be able to halt or adjust. It should use inputs from Technical (Module 4\) regarding liquidity warnings or timing (e.g. avoid executing during known illiquid periods or just before major news). The RL module (8) might also directly suggest micro-timing (like “wait till last hour to execute”); execution should incorporate such policies as long as risk is ok.

**How to Execute:** Connect to a **paper trading or simulation environment** first (like an exchange simulator or use historical data to simulate order fills) to test execution algorithms. Implement the Almgren-Chriss model by solving its optimal control equations (there are known formulas for optimal slicing given simple assumptions). Alternatively, use a simpler heuristic to start: e.g. TWAP over a day for large orders. Build an interface (API or broker integration) for sending orders. For safety, start with small orders to validate behavior. Incorporate **logging** of every fill and decision. As the system learns, you can consider more advanced execution, even an RL policy that learns how to execute (but that’s covered in Module 8). Always keep a manual override or emergency stop on the execution system, especially in early phases, in case it behaves unexpectedly.

### **7\. Scenarios & Stress Testing (Counterfactual Lab) – *Adversarial and What-If Analysis***

**Mandate:** Continuously test the portfolio against hypothetical adverse scenarios and stress events **before** the market does. This module generates simulated “what-if” scenarios to expose vulnerabilities and create contingency plans.

* **Historical Replay & Shock Scenarios:** Build a library of historical crisis scenarios (2008 crash, 2020 pandemic shock, etc.). Periodically (e.g. nightly or weekly), **simulate the current portfolio through these historical periods** to estimate how it would perform. Use block bootstrap or actual time series from those periods applied to today’s positions. Identify the potential P\&L drawdowns, margin usage, etc. Additionally, create **synthetic shocks**: e.g. “What if oil prices jump 30% overnight?” or “What if a 5σ interest rate move occurs?” by shocking relevant factors and propagating through the portfolio.

* **Regime-Conditional Stressing:** Tailor scenarios to current regime – e.g. in a low-vol regime, test a sudden vol spike (since complacency is a risk); in a high-inflation regime, test a deflation shock, etc. Use **copulas or correlated Monte Carlo** methods to generate plausible multi-asset moves that respect historical correlations but hit extreme values. For each scenario, compute portfolio losses and identify which positions contribute most to the tail loss (tail attribution).

* **Adversarial Perturbations:** Incorporate techniques from adversarial machine learning: slightly perturb model inputs (like slight change in a key assumption or a slight shift in a price series) to see if any module’s output changes drastically. For example, if a small change in one stock’s price causes the allocation to flip drastically, that indicates an over-sensitive strategy. The scenario module should find these edge cases. It can also test sequences of events that an adversary might exploit (tie-in with Module 9’s adversaries): e.g. “if someone tried to manipulate a stock’s closing price, how would our system react?”

* **Outputs:** The module produces **P\&L distribution forecasts** (for various horizon scenarios), lists of **breach events** (e.g. “In scenario X, margin call would occur” or “VaR limit breaks under scenario Y”), and **contingency plans or warnings**. For instance, output could be: *“Scenario: 10% overnight market gap – projected portfolio loss \= 8%, triggers StopLoss on positions A, B.”* These findings should be summarized and fed to the Overseer and Risk. If a scenario reveals too large an exposure to a single factor, it might recommend hedging or reducing that position proactively.

* **Integration:** Feed scenario analysis results to the Risk Management module (to adjust limits or prepare circuit breakers) and to the Overseer (which might incorporate scenario worst-case outcomes into its decision – e.g. avoid trades that would be catastrophic in plausible scenarios). Also share with humans (if any in oversight) for review. Over time, use outcomes to refine models: e.g. if a scenario consistently shows a weakness, either adjust the portfolio or improve a model that perhaps underestimates that risk.

**How to Execute:** Start by scripting a set of scenarios. Use historical data for key risk factors: equity indices, rates, credit spreads, etc. Then *map current positions to those factors* (e.g. beta of a stock to index, etc.) to estimate impact. For each scenario, calculate P\&L of each position (stock moves, plus any hedges). Identify pain points. This can be implemented as a batch job that runs offline and produces a report. As the system matures, incorporate it into daily routine. Use Python libraries for copulas or Monte Carlo to create random but realistic shock scenarios (e.g. drawing from a multivariate distribution of asset returns with tail-dependence). Then gradually automate responses: e.g. if a scenario outcome exceeds a threshold (loss \> X%), have the system notify risk or reduce positions. This module will evolve with human input: risk managers (or you, as the designer) might add new scenarios based on current events (e.g. war outbreak, political unrest) – ensure the framework allows easy addition of new scenario generators.

### **8\. Reinforcement Learning (Policy Learner under Law) – *Adaptive Policy Learning for Timing***

**Mandate:** Use Reinforcement Learning to let the system **learn execution and timing policies** that maximize reward (returns) while adhering to risk constraints. The RL agent doesn’t decide *what* to buy (that comes from other signals) but learns *when and how* to act for best results within the safety limits.

* **Risk-Sensitive Reward Shaping:** Design the RL reward function to include returns and penalties for risk. For example, use **CVaR-aware objectives** – reward the agent for profits but heavily penalize outcomes where portfolio losses fall in worst percentile (to enforce tail-risk aversion). This ensures the RL agent’s policy doesn’t chase high returns by ignoring rare disasters. Additionally, penalize excessive turnover or violation of risk limits in the reward to naturally discourage those actions.

* **Offline Training with Historical Data:** Before deploying live, train the RL agent on past data (offline) to learn from historical market scenarios. Use **Conservative Q-Learning (CQL)** or other offline RL techniques to avoid overestimating value from limited data. The agent could simulate trading decisions (e.g. deciding each day whether to increase/decrease a position given state inputs like signals and risk metrics) and learn which actions would have led to good outcomes. Include diverse market periods in training so it learns behavior across regimes.

* **Imitation and Safe Exploration:** Incorporate **imitation learning** from the best historical policies or human expert strategies if available. For instance, if there are known good responses (like “always reduce exposure during Fed announcements”), feed those as examples so the agent can mimic them. During live operation, keep the RL agent in check with constraints via Lagrange multipliers or by gating its actions through the Risk module (so it literally *cannot* execute an unsafe action). Use a slowly increasing exploration parameter – initially the agent might only make small adjustments around the human/heuristic policy, and as it proves itself, it gains more autonomy.

* **Outputs:** The RL agent can output *policy suggestions* such as: *“Delay buying until afternoon dip”*, *“Sell half position ahead of earnings event”*, or even numeric adjustments (like a multiplier on position size to implement given current confidence). Essentially, it provides timing signals or trade refinement. These suggestions should come with an **uncertainty or confidence** estimate (so the Overseer knows how much to trust it). The RL agent is **not allowed to change overall exposure beyond risk limits** – it works *within the law* (hence the name), fine-tuning the execution.

* **Integration:** Treat the RL suggestions as an additional input to the Overseer/Execution. For example, the Overseer might ask: “Given the current signals and risk OK, *when* should we execute?” The RL agent answers with a timing (e.g. “split entry over next 2 days, because liquidity is better”). If RL’s confidence is low or it conflicts with a hard rule, the Overseer can ignore it. Over time, if the RL agent shows good performance (tracked via evaluation metrics like info-ratio of its suggestions), it can be given more weight. It should run continuously in the background, updating its policy with new data (possibly via online learning if safe).

**How to Execute:** Define the **state space** for the RL agent – likely consisting of recent signals (sentiment, technical trend, etc.), position state, market liquidity, and risk metrics. Define actions – maybe a discrete set like {accelerate trade, hold, decelerate, hedge, etc.} or continuous adjustment factors. Choose an RL algorithm suitable for risk constraints, like **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** with modifications or **Policy Gradient** with risk penalty. Use historical simulation to generate episodes: simulate how different actions at different times would have affected final P\&L or drawdown. This requires a trading environment simulator – you can code a simplified one that steps through days and executes trades according to the agent’s action, then computes reward. Train the model on this. Test its decisions against known sensible behavior. Once somewhat validated, integrate it in shadow mode: let it make recommendations while you or the system still ultimately decides, to evaluate its suggestions. Only when it consistently adds value and respects constraints should it start directly influencing live trades. Keep retraining/updating it with new data (perhaps via an online learning approach, but carefully to avoid drift – occasional re-training on the growing dataset might be safer).

### **9\. Game Theory (Adversary Model) – *Anticipating Other Market Players’ Strategies***

**Mandate:** Assume the presence of strategic opponents in the market (competitors, market makers, manipulators) and integrate that into planning. Model how adversaries might respond to our actions or how they might be influencing market moves, to adjust strategy accordingly.

* **Signaling Games in News & Earnings:** Treat certain market events as **games**. For example, when a company issues an earnings press release, it could be playing a “cheap talk” game – trying to spin the narrative. The game theory module can analyze such communications: detect if management’s tone or wording in guidance might be strategically upbeat to prop the stock (versus genuine). Use NLP to detect discrepancies (e.g. positive language but weak numbers could indicate bluffing). This can influence sentiment analysis by discounting overly rosy statements.

* **Market Impact Games (Stackelberg):** Model the interaction with market makers/liquidity. For execution, view it as a **Stackelberg game** where our system is the leader or follower depending on situation: e.g. if we place large orders, a market maker will notice and adjust spreads (adversarial to us); anticipate this by maybe splitting orders or using dark pools. Alternatively, if we detect another large player accumulating (unusual volume patterns), anticipate their moves – e.g. position ahead or avoid trading at the same time. Develop simple game-theoretic models: like if we trade too predictably, others could exploit; hence randomize some execution timing to remain unpredictable.

* **Adversarial Risk Premiums:** Use game theory to identify where the strategy might be paying a “tax” to more informed players. For instance, if a strategy consistently loses money right after trades, maybe it’s getting picked off by HFTs. Quantify this by analyzing execution slippage beyond expectations. If found, adjust strategy to avoid being the loser in that game (maybe trade at different times or use limit orders). Also, identify **spoofing or manipulation** attempts (e.g. sudden large orders canceled) via pattern detection, and avoid reacting to those short-term false signals. The module can raise **alarms** when such patterns occur (so other modules like Technical or RL don’t overreact to a spoof).

* **Outputs:** This module might not produce continuous numeric signals like others, but rather **qualitative flags or adjustments**. For example: *“Adversary detected: likely large seller in XYZ – reduce our long position or wait”*, or *“Earnings language suggests strategic exaggeration – sentiment score adjusted down”*. It can also output an **“adversarial risk premium”** metric, estimating how much performance is lost to adversaries, which could be fed to Risk or RL as something to minimize.

* **Integration:** Feed these outputs into decision-making by altering either the signals or execution: e.g. if adversary flag on a stock, maybe Overseer lowers the trust in signals for that stock short-term (knowing the price may be manipulated or supply/demand imbalanced). If a spoofing alarm triggers, the execution module could pause trading until it passes. Over time, track if these adversary alerts improve outcomes (this goes into Evaluation).

**How to Execute:** Start by analyzing historical data around known manipulation events (if available) or simply look at patterns where our backtests showed unexpected losses. Develop detection logic (could be heuristic rules or anomaly detection models) for things like: large order book imbalances that disappear (spoof), or stock price moves that revert immediately (possible manipulation). For signaling games, incorporate a small NLP model to analyze company statements vs outcomes (even a simple keyword analysis for overly optimistic language). Consult finance literature on game-theoretic models for market impact to design some simple predictive rules. This module might be more research-heavy; treat it as an ongoing R\&D that gradually provides tools to the main system. Initially, it could just log observations, and only later directly modify signals. Make sure to validate any intervention it suggests (so it doesn’t accidentally make things worse by seeing false “ghost” adversaries).

### **10\. Regime Recognition & Adaptation (Playbook Switchboard) – *Dynamic Strategy Switching***

**Mandate:** Automatically recognize structural shifts in market dynamics and **adapt the strategy**, by switching models, horizons, or parameters. (This is closely linked to Module 0’s Overseer, but here the focus is on detection and adaptation mechanisms in detail.)

* **Change-Point Detection:** Implement statistical **change-point detection** algorithms (e.g. CUSUM tests, Bayesian online change-point detection) on key market statistics like volatility, correlations, or factor returns. These detect when the distribution of returns shifts – signaling a possible new regime. For example, a sustained change in correlation between stocks and bonds might indicate a regime change in risk-on/risk-off behavior. When a change is detected with high confidence, alert the system to reevaluate current regime classification.

* **Clustering & Spectral Analysis:** Use **unsupervised learning** to cluster historical market periods based on features (volatility, liquidity, momentum, valuation spreads, etc.). This could be spectral clustering or self-organizing maps, etc. Label these clusters as regimes (bull, bear, panic, bubble, etc.) and train a model that given current features, outputs the likelihood of being in each regime. The adaptation module monitors those probabilities – if a new cluster (regime) probability starts to dominate, it triggers the *playbook switch*. Ensure a smoothing mechanism (hysteresis) as mentioned to avoid rapid oscillation.

* **Playbook Management:** Maintain a set of **configuration profiles** (playbooks) for each regime: e.g. in “high volatility bear market”, use tighter risk limits, shorten the trading horizon (favor t1 trades over t3), emphasize technical signals (if fundamentals are less predictive in panics), etc. The adaptation module is responsible for executing the switch: when regime detection says “new regime \= X”, the module updates global settings – e.g., notifies all modules of the regime change so they can adjust (some modules might load different parameter sets optimized for that regime). Also possibly warm up or spin up any models needed for that regime that might have been idle.

* **Learning New Regimes:** Incorporate **Bayesian model averaging** to handle regime uncertainty – if unsure, combine predictions from models of multiple regimes weighted by their probability. Also, if a truly novel regime occurs (something historically unseen), the system should recognize high uncertainty and perhaps default to conservative settings. Logging such periods for future analysis is important (so later one can update the regime taxonomy).

* **Outputs:** The primary output is a **regime label** (with start time and confidence) broadcast to all components. Additionally, a **model weight vector** or policy parameter set corresponding to that regime. For example: `{"regime":"low_vol_carry", "model_weights":{"sentiment":0.2,"fundamental":0.4,"technical":0.4}, "min_horizon":"t3"}` meaning in this regime, fundamentals and technicals get higher weight, and we focus on longer horizon trades. Also output **hysteresis signals** – e.g. a lock-in period or a requirement that a regime persists a certain length before another change is allowed (this can be as simple as “no regime change until 5 days after last switch, unless confidence \> 99%”).

* **Integration:** This module works hand-in-hand with the Overseer (0). In fact, it could be considered part of the Overseer’s functionality. It ensures that all other modules are context-aware: e.g., the RL agent might use different policies per regime; the risk module might tighten limits in a risk-off regime; the sentiment module might see different typical impacts (e.g. social media hype might matter more in bubble regimes). Thus, integration means every module’s logic should incorporate the regime label in its decision process. Testing this integration is key: simulate scenarios where regime changes (e.g. bull to bear) and verify the system smoothly transitions (positions are adjusted, signals recalibrated, etc.).

**How to Execute:** Use historical data to define regimes first. You can perform **unsupervised clustering** on past market periods (perhaps using PCA and clustering on monthly return/correlation patterns). Label these clusters informally and design playbooks for each. Implement real-time change detection: for instance, a simple approach is to maintain running metrics (like 20-day volatility) and if it deviates from its 100-day range beyond a threshold, signal regime change. Or use a probability filter: at each time, update P(regime \= i) for each regime i using a Bayesian updater given new data; switch regime when one probability exceeds, say, 0.8 and was previously low. Develop a configuration management in code such that each module can query what the current regime is and adjust parameters. Test by backtesting the entire system through known regime shifts (e.g. pre-COVID bull \-\> COVID crash \-\> recovery) and see if it adapts appropriately (it might reduce exposure before/during the crash, etc.). This will likely be iterative to fine-tune sensitivity.

### **11\. Satellite Social Media & Web Traffic (Alt-Data Eyes) – *Attention and Demand Signals from Alternative Data***

**Mandate:** Incorporate non-traditional data sources (social media trends, Google search trends, web traffic, etc.) to gauge public attention and intent that might not yet be reflected in prices or fundamentals. These act as “eyes and ears” on the broader world, catching early signs of shifting demand or sentiment. \* of particularly interest to attack retail traders.

* **Attention Metrics:** Track **search engine trends** (e.g. Google Trends for company names, products, or relevant themes) as a proxy for public interest. Spikes in search volume often precede news or earnings surprises (e.g. sudden surge in searches for a product could mean strong sales). Similarly, monitor website traffic stats for key companies (if available via analytics or third-party estimates) – an increase may indicate business momentum.

* **Social Graph Analysis:** Beyond textual sentiment (Module 2), analyze **social network structure** for narratives. For example, use graph centrality measures on Twitter or Reddit: identify if a certain topic or stock is becoming highly connected or influential in conversation networks. A high centrality or rapidly increasing mentions network could signal a building narrative that might drive momentum. Use anomaly detection on these time-series (to find unusual spikes).

* **Lag-Lead Mapping:** Research and establish **lead/lag relationships** between these alt-data indicators and market moves. For instance, does a jump in Google searches lead a stock price jump by a few days? If yes, calibrate a signal that triggers on the alt-data move with a certain lag. Use **transfer entropy** or Granger causality tests to validate these lead relationships. Only adopt those that are persistent and logical (e.g. web traffic rising leading revenue beat \-\> stock up).

* **Outputs:** Produce **attention nowcast signals**: e.g. a daily or weekly indicator per stock or sector that reflects how much “buzz” or interest is building in alt-data. Could be a standardized score (e.g. percentile relative to past year). Also, generate **attention shock alerts** – if an alt-data metric goes well beyond normal range (like 5σ move in search volume), flag it as a potential catalyst event. For e-commerce companies, a **demand nowcast** (predicting the current quarter sales from web/app usage data) can be output as a numeric forecast, which feeds into the fundamentals module’s valuation.

* **Failure Modes:** Recognize hype cycles – alt-data can spike on hype that doesn’t translate to long-term value (e.g. viral memes). Mitigate by applying **fast decay** to these signals: assume the impact decays quickly unless corroborated by fundamentals or actual news. If an alt-data signal stands alone without confirmation from other modules after some time, drop its weight (to avoid chasing fads).

* **Integration:** The alt-data signals can enhance both the **sentiment** and **fundamental** modules. For sentiment, they quantify breadth of attention (not just tone). For fundamentals, they provide early estimates of business performance. The Overseer might use an alt-data shock as a trigger to investigate a stock more closely (or even prompt the RL agent to reduce positions if the shock could indicate looming volatility). Make sure the context management (below) captures these signals so they’re considered alongside traditional data in decisions.

**How to Execute:** Identify data sources: set up API access or scraping for Google Trends (Google has an API for normalized interest over time), Twitter (count mentions of tickers or hashtags), Reddit (posts in finance subreddits), etc., plus any specialized sources (like SimilarWeb for website traffic). Create a small data pipeline to fetch and update these daily. Normalize the data (maybe 0-100 scales per series). Apply smoothing or outlier treatment as needed. Then run correlation/lag analysis versus price or revenue data to find predictive power. Initially, pick a few promising indicators for integration. For example, if searches for “electric vehicles” spike and you track EV-related stocks, turn that into a “sector attention” signal. Integrate by simply having the Overseer treat it like another signal source (with a modest weight that can increase if historically it proved useful). Over time, as more alt-data is added, consider using a machine learning model to combine them (e.g. a tree-based model that predicts short-term returns from a vector of alt-data indicators). But be cautious of overfitting — validate on out-of-sample periods. Always maintain a quick decay unless reaffirmed, to not let stale hype linger in the model.

### **12\. Cyclical Patterns & Seasonality (Temporal Skeleton) – *Calendar Effects and Periodic Patterns***

**Mandate:** Account for known periodic patterns (seasonal or calendar effects) so the system doesn’t mistake these for alpha. Incorporate these patterns as a baseline context – essentially the “skeleton” on which other signals ride.

* **Seasonal Decomposition:** Use techniques like **STL (Seasonal-Trend Decomposition)** on price and fundamental time series to extract seasonal components. For example, many stocks have seasonal earnings patterns (retail stronger in holidays, etc.). Remove or flag these seasonal influences in the data feeding other models so that, say, the RL agent or technical module doesn’t overreact to an expected year-end rally that happens most years. Maintain a **seasonality calendar** with effects like “January effect” (small caps often rise in Jan), “sell in May”, end-of-quarter portfolio rebalancing flows, option expiration volatility, holiday low-liquidity periods, etc.

* **Feature Engineering:** Create features that represent the time of year, month, week, and even day if intraday patterns matter. For example, a feature that is 1 during the last 5 trading days of the quarter and 0 otherwise, to catch quarter-end effects. Or dummy variables for each month to capture monthly seasonality in returns or volatility. These features can be fed into other models (like a regression for expected return that includes a seasonal feature, or into the RL agent’s state so it *knows* about these cycles).

* **Periodic Signals:** Identify if there are exploitable seasonal patterns — e.g., an index tends to rise in the first half of December historically. While the mandate is not to chase these blindly, the system can be aware of them. Possibly incorporate a **seasonal baseline forecast** for each period. Then any deviation from this baseline is what other signals should explain. For instance, if normally an asset rises \+2% in a particular month, but current signals suggest it will do \+5%, that \+3% above seasonal norm is the real alpha if correct. The seasonal module could output that baseline expectation so the Overseer can adjust position (maybe take a bit of profit earlier if it knows a typical pattern might reverse).

* **Failure Mode:** Avoid over-imprinting on the calendar. Ensure that seasonal patterns included are statistically significant and persistent. Provide **confidence levels** for each seasonal effect. If an effect weakens or disappears in recent years, phase it out (the module should continuously re-evaluate seasonality with expanding data). Treat seasonals as **priors**: they set expectations, but the system shouldn’t follow them rigidly if other evidence contradicts (e.g. if usually summer is quiet but there’s a major event causing volatility, obviously override the seasonal expectation).

* **Outputs:** Key outputs include a **seasonal adjustment factor** for returns or risk (like expected volatility increase in certain months), and **seasonal context flags** (e.g. “Earnings season coming – expect higher volatility on individual stocks” or “Summer doldrums – lower baseline volumes”). These might be simple text/comment or numerical adjustments to other signals. For integration, perhaps produce a JSON like `{"period":"year_end","expected_pattern":"positive drift","avg_effect":"+1.5%","confidence":0.8}` as a summary for current date range.

* **Integration:** Other modules can subscribe to these outputs. For example, Risk Management may temporarily tighten limits if entering a historically volatile period. The technical module might adjust its threshold for what constitutes an unusual price move if seasonality predicts a drift. The Overseer can use seasonal baselines to modulate signal strengths (if a normally positive period is coming, maybe require extra confirmation to short a stock, and vice versa). Essentially it provides context so the rest of the system’s decisions are seasonally aware.

**How to Execute:** Perform back-analysis on historical price data to quantify calendar effects. This could be as straightforward as averaging returns by month and checking significance, or as advanced as fitting a seasonal component in a time-series model. Maintain and update these stats yearly. Implement logic to generate a forward calendar: e.g., list of dates with known effects (economic releases, Fed meetings, holidays, etc.) and typical market behavior around them. This can start simple (maybe just a few well-known patterns) and expand with research. Code the usage: e.g., if today’s date is in the last week of December, the seasonal module flags “year-end rally usually \+X%”. Feed this info into the context that the LLM agents or models get (for example, include a feature or a note in the prompt that it’s year-end). Test by checking past situations where ignoring seasonality led to mistakes, and see if this module would have corrected that. One must also integrate carefully – avoid giving contradictory signals (seasonal says up but all other signals say down; in such cases the system might decide the non-seasonal info indicates this time is different).

### **13\. Intermarket Analysis (Macro Topology) – *Cross-Asset and Macro Linkages***

**Mandate:** Interpret the equity market in the context of other markets – interest rates, currencies (FX), credit, commodities – to understand macro forces and hedge or capitalize on cross-asset moves.

* **Dynamic Correlations:** Continuously measure correlations between the portfolio’s assets and major macro indices: e.g. S\&P 500 vs 10-year Treasury yield, vs USD index, vs oil prices, etc. Use a rolling window to see if correlations are stable or shifting. A sudden correlation change can signal a regime shift or a new macro driver emerging (e.g. equities and bonds flipping from inverse to positive correlation is notable). Also check **equity sector vs macro** (tech stocks vs interest rates, etc.). Update these estimates frequently.

* **Lead-Lag Relationships:** Perform **Granger causality tests** and compute **transfer entropy** between markets to detect lead-lag. For instance, do bond moves lead stock moves lately (common in some regimes)? Does credit spread widening foreshadow equity downturns? If yes, incorporate that: e.g. if yields spike (and we know yields lead stocks down by a few days in current regime), the system can pre-emptively reduce equity exposure. Maintain a set of **macro early indicators** (like key yield curves, credit indices, commodity prices) to watch for signals.

* **Cointegration & Relative Value:** Identify pairs or groups of assets that move together long-term (cointegration). E.g., perhaps a stock is linked to a commodity (oil producers vs oil price). If the price diverges, it could be an opportunity or risk (the stock might revert or there's a structural break). Have models to test and alert when such divergences occur beyond a threshold.

* **Outputs:** The intermarket module outputs **cross-asset pressure scores** – e.g. a summary of whether macro factors are providing a tailwind or headwind to the equity positions. For each major macro factor, it could give a score or qualitative direction (e.g. “Rates rising rapidly – negative for tech stocks, caution on duration-sensitive positions”). Also suggest **hedge candidates**: e.g. if portfolio is very equity-heavy, it might suggest “consider shorting high-yield credit or buying volatility as a hedge given current macro signals.” Additionally, output **macro constraint flags** if certain cross-asset constraints are hit (like if an equity position effectively implies a big bet on a macro factor outside desired scope, flag it).

* **Integration:** The Overseer and Risk use this info to adjust exposures – e.g. if macro analysis says high risk of equity drop due to external factors, Risk could tighten VaR limits or the Overseer might scale down positions. The allocation module could incorporate macro inputs in its forecasts (like include expected returns for assets influenced by macro factors). If a hedge is suggested, Execution might actually implement it (if within mandate). Also, context for LLM agents: if an LLM agent (like the Dispatch agent from system prompt, perhaps) is writing analysis, it should include these macro insights.

**How to Execute:** Set up data feeds for macro variables (Treasury yields, economic data releases, commodity prices, FX rates). Automate correlation calculations (rolling correlations updated daily or intraday). Implement Granger causality tests in Python (statsmodels library has one) between key series on a rolling basis. Keep track of which relationships are currently significant. For cointegration, you can use the Engle-Granger two-step method or Johansen test on pairs (this could be done offline and monitored). Summarize the macro state: you might create a small expert system that translates macro movements into plain English signals (like rules: “if real yield up \> \+0.2 in a week and correlation tech vs yield is \-0.8, then output ‘rising yields pressuring tech’”). Integrate by feeding these outputs into the overall decision logic – likely through the Overseer which might incorporate a “macro score” into its weighting. Test on historical episodes: e.g. see if before past equity selloffs, macro module would have flashed warning (if yes, good, if it also flashes many false warnings, adjust thresholds or logic).

### **14\. Behavioral Econ**

### **Integration & Communication Protocol – *How the Pieces Talk to Each Other***

To tie all modules together, establish a **strict communication protocol** using standardized data objects, ensuring each component’s outputs can be consumed by others without ambiguity (minimizing reliance on unstructured language). This structured approach prevents context loss and keeps agents focused[tradingagents-ai.github.io](https://tradingagents-ai.github.io/#:~:text=Types%20of%20Agent%20Interactions).

* **Standard Signal Object:** Define a JSON schema for a **Signal** that any analytical module (2 through 4, 11–13) will emit. As given in the doctrine, include fields like:

  * `id` (unique signal ID),

  * `family` (which module or type: \`"sentiment"|"fundamental"|"technical"|"macro"|...),

  * `entity` (what asset/sector/topic it refers to),

  * `timestamp`,

  * `score` (the core numeric value or strength of the signal),

  * `confidence`,

  * `horizon` (intended horizon like intraday, daily, weekly),

  * `regime` (the regime context when it was generated),

  * `explain` (a list of key reasons or sub-signals, e.g. narrative topics or factor names).  
     Each module populates this accordingly. For example, a sentiment signal might be:  
     `{"id":"sig_123", "family":"sentiment", "entity":"AAPL", "score":0.72, "confidence":0.81, "horizon":"daily", "regime":"bull_lowvol", "explain":["topic:AI_hype","tone:very_positive","surprise:+1.3σ"]}`.

* **Policy Proposal Object:** Define a JSON for **Policy Proposal** that the Overseer (fusion layer) produces. Fields:

  * `target` (asset or portfolio target),

  * `delta_exposure` (proposed change in exposure, e.g. \+0.10 meaning increase position by 10% of NAV),

  * `time_window` (e.g. “next\_2d” meaning execute over next 2 days),

  * `rationale` (array of reasons, referencing which signals drove it, e.g. `["value_mispricing","momentum_confirmed","sentiment_tailwind"]`),

  * `constraints_checked` (list of constraints that were OK when proposing, e.g. `["VaR_ok","liquidity_ok"]`).  
     This object represents a candidate action that then goes to Risk for approval.

* **Risk Verdict Object:** Define JSON for **Risk Verdict** from Module 1:

  * `target` (echo the asset),

  * `status` (`"APPROVED"`, `"DOWNGRADED"`, or `"REJECTED"`),

  * `reason` (if not approved, a code like `"ES_breach"`, `"limit_exceeded"`, `"regime_mismatch"` etc.).  
     E.g. `{"target":"AAPL","status":"DOWNGRADED","reason":"turnover_excess"}` meaning risk suggests smaller size due to too much turnover. The Overseer would then scale down the `delta_exposure`.

* **Communication Mechanism:** Implement a **pub-sub bus or shared memory** where modules publish these JSON messages. For example, use a lightweight message queue (RabbitMQ, Redis pub/sub, etc.) or even a simple database table that modules write to and read from. The Overseer subscribes to all *Signal* messages. When it forms a *Policy Proposal*, it publishes it, which triggers the Risk module to consume it and respond with a *Risk Verdict*. Execution then acts on the approved policy. This asynchronous, decoupled communication ensures modularity.

* **Minimal Natural Language:** Keep inter-module communication in data form. Reserve natural language output only for external consumption or final explanation to humans. This structured approach was validated in research (agents exchanging structured reports to preserve info and allow querying global state)[tradingagents-ai.github.io](https://tradingagents-ai.github.io/#:~:text=Types%20of%20Agent%20Interactions). It prevents misunderstandings that could occur if one agent’s output was a long text. Each module should adhere strictly to the schemas (making it easier to validate and trust each other’s outputs). Implement schema validators to enforce this.

**How to Execute:** Early on, decide on the technology for message passing (e.g. in-memory Python objects if all modules run in one process vs a message broker if distributed). Set up the schemas (perhaps using JSON Schema definitions) and share them across modules. Build a **communication manager** that can route messages: for instance, when a sentiment agent finishes processing news, it calls a function `publish_signal(signal_json)`. The Overseer might call `get_latest_signals()` to gather recent signals from all families. Logging every message to a central log or database is useful for later analysis/debugging. Test the end-to-end flow with a simple scenario (e.g. one sentiment signal \-\> overseer proposal \-\> risk check \-\> execution order) to ensure all parts speak correctly. As more modules are added, ensure each new signal type adheres to the contract and that the Overseer knows how to interpret it (could be as simple as reading the `score` and having predefined meaning for each family).

### **Context Management & Memory (Context Economy) – *Efficient Information Summarization for LLM Agents***

Because some components (like the analysis agents or Overseer if it’s LLM-based) may rely on large context windows, manage the “context economy” carefully to avoid overload and maintain relevant information in prompts.

* **Summaries First:** Any long raw text or data (e.g. a 100-page financial report or a stream of raw news) should first be processed into a **summary or structured digest** before being fed to an LLM agent. Use specialized summarizer sub-agents or algorithms to condense information into bullet points with key facts and perhaps source citations. This ensures that when the LLM (say the Dispatch agent or the Rhetoric evaluator) gets the info, it’s already trimmed to essentials, preventing dilution by irrelevant details.

* **Rolling Synopses:** Maintain a **rolling synopsis** for each entity (stock, sector, etc.) that captures recent key points and state in \~800-1000 tokens. This synopsis is updated as new information arrives (like a sliding window of narrative). When an agent needs context on that entity, prepend this synopsis to its prompt. This way, the agent is always aware of the recent context (last few days/weeks of news, recent signals from other modules) without loading all raw data. Essentially, it’s a form of memory that gets refreshed incrementally (diff updates).

* **Top-K Retrieval:** If an agent needs to reason about a specific question or decision, implement a **retrieval mechanism** that selects the top-K most relevant pieces of information for that query. For example, use vector embeddings to store all past signals or news, and retrieve those most similar to the current situation query (hybrid of semantic similarity and recency ranking). Only provide those top-K chunks (each maybe a few hundred tokens) to the agent to consider. This ensures the agent isn’t blindsided by missing info, while also not swamped by too much data.

* **Hard Context Limits:** Enforce an upper bound on context size (e.g. never more than 8k tokens fed into an LLM at once). If assembling information would exceed this, apply more aggressive summarization or omission of less important pieces. Consider a priority system: crucial risk alerts or regime info always included, whereas older, low-impact details get dropped first. If necessary, have the agent work iteratively: e.g. first ask a question to narrow down what info is needed, then retrieve just that.

* **Execution:** Implement a **context manager service** in the platform. For instance, whenever a new significant event occurs (a big signal, a regime change, etc.), update the relevant synopsis (could be a simple text file or database entry that accumulates bullet points). Use an embedding model (like SBERT or similar) to index all facts and allow querying. When an LLM agent (like the policy decision agent if it’s an LLM) is called, have a pre-processing step that pulls the most relevant synopsis info and attaches it to the prompt. This design keeps the LLM agents efficient and focused, which is critical given the 10k token limit described.

### **Guardrails & Safety Checks – *Built-in Safeguards as a Peer Agent***

Embedding guardrails throughout the system is crucial. Treat the **guardrails as their own implicit agent**, constantly monitoring outputs for validity and safety, rather than an afterthought.

* **Structural Guardrails:** Enforce correct output **formats and schemas** at each step. For example, after an LLM agent generates a JSON output (like a signal or decision), run it through a JSON schema validator. If it fails, either correct it automatically or reject and refire the agent with a prompt to fix it. Also apply **unit bounds and monotonicity checks** as applicable: e.g. if sentiment strength is 5 (max), sign cannot be negative (monotonic mapping). If an agent suggests a trade that is larger than allowed position size, cap it. These checks ensure no module outputs something out-of-contract that could throw off another module.

* **Statistical Guardrails:** Use anomaly detection on module outputs. For example, if the technical analysis suddenly gives a wildly different signal score than it ever has, flag it (maybe there’s a data error). Check consistency: if fundamentals say a stock is very undervalued but price hasn’t moved, that might be fine; but if fundamentals and sentiment are extremely divergent (one says strong buy, the other strong sell), maybe flag for the Overseer to examine conflict more carefully (could be a regime issue or data error). Also, maintain **anchors**: e.g., the fundamental values act as an anchor – if a price target output by RL or an LLM is hugely distant from any fundamental reality, treat it with suspicion. Essentially, create rules like “if output deviates beyond X sigma from rolling mean or from other module consensus, require confirmation or dampen it.”

* **Procedural Guardrails:** Implement multi-agent consensus or approval for high-impact decisions. The “two-key” rule from risk is one – any trade above a certain risk threshold requires Risk module sign-off. Similarly, maybe require at least two independent signals to agree before taking a large position (e.g. won’t act on a pure sentiment spike if fundamentals and technicals don’t also show something, unless it’s small). The Overseer cannot override these; it can only escalate issues to human oversight if needed, but not bypass. Have explicit **no-go policies**: e.g. “Never go all-in on a single position,” “No self-overriding: if Risk says no, it’s no.” Program these as hard logic.

* **Human Failsafes:** (Even in this autonomous plan, during initial deployment) keep a “human-in-the-loop” failsafe: e.g. require manual review for any trade that breaches a secondary threshold or any algorithmic halt. At least until the system proves itself, a human or a monitoring process should be alerted for extreme actions. This can be via a simple notification system for now. The goal is the system is autonomous, but this catch-net prevents catastrophe from unforeseen bugs.

**How to Execute:** Develop a **validation library** that each module calls on its outputs. For instance, after generating the Policy Proposal JSON, run `validate_proposal(json)` which checks schema and content (like delta\_exposure within bounds, etc.). If something is off, either automatically adjust (e.g. clip values to limit) or have a fallback (maybe the Overseer defaults to flat if proposal invalid). Similarly, set up cross-module sanity checks: e.g. if RL suggests adding risk when all other signals say reduce, perhaps delay that action or require a second confirmation cycle. Use backtesting to identify what checks would have prevented the worst outcomes historically. Implement those as code or conditions. Create a **monitor dashboard** that tracks key stats (current VaR, current exposures, any limit utilization). This dashboard can have built-in triggers to pause trading or send alerts if anomalies occur. Treat these guardrails as an integral part of the codebase – with as much attention as the models themselves – since they significantly reduce the chance of ruin.

### **Evaluation & Continuous Improvement – *Metrics that Matter and Learning Loops***

To ensure the system remains *world-class*, continually evaluate each module’s performance with relevant metrics and use those insights to retrain or adjust the models and strategies.

* **Risk Module KPIs:** Monitor **realized vs. predicted risk**. Track how often actual losses exceed VaR (99% VaR should be exceeded \~1% of the time – if more, the model underestimates risk, adjust it). Check **max drawdown** in live trading vs the set limits. Also track **turnover vs limits** (are we churning the portfolio too much). If slippage is consistently higher than expected (execution shortfall), feed that back to Execution module to recalibrate impact models.

* **Sentiment Module KPIs:** Calculate the **correlation of sentiment signals with future returns** (e.g. 1-day to 5-day ahead returns) conditional on regimes. Ideally, in regimes where sentiment is supposed to matter (maybe retail-driven markets), the correlation or information coefficient should be significantly positive. Monitor the **decay half-life** of sentiment signals: e.g. how long does a news shock impact price? If the model is good, it should catch that window. If signals decay faster or slower, adjust horizon assumptions. Also track if certain sources are leading the signals astray (maybe too many false positives from social media hype – if so, adjust source weighting).

* **Fundamentals Module KPIs:** Measure **Rank IC (information coefficient)** of the mispricing scores – essentially the correlation between the module’s rankings and subsequent returns over a quarter or year. If the rank IC is low or negative, the factors may need revamp. Check how often the actual price converges to the fair value band; also track **drift of fair-value errors** (if the model consistently underestimates growth stocks or overestimates certain sectors, recalibrate those segments). Monitor **hit-rate after earnings**: when the company reports new financials, does it move in the direction the fundamentals module predicted (e.g. if module said undervalued, does it jump on earnings)? Use that as feedback.

* **Technical Module KPIs:** Evaluate **signal hit-ratio** conditional on volatility buckets. For example, when technical module issued a breakout alert in high-vol regime, was it profitable X% of the time? When it said mean-revert in low-vol, how often did that play out? Track latency: how quickly does it catch a trend change? If it’s too lagging, consider more reactive indicators; if too noisy, perhaps smooth more. Ensure it’s not overfit by verifying performance in different time periods.

* **Allocation & Execution KPIs:** Ultimately, track **information ratio (IR)** of the portfolio (excess return / volatility) net of costs. The allocation should improve IR compared to equal-weight or other baselines. If not, maybe the optimizer is wrong or over-constrained. Check **budget efficiency** – e.g. return per unit of capital or per trade: are we allocating capital to the most effective signals? If a small portion of the portfolio yields most returns, maybe increase allocation there (unless risk says no). For execution, monitor **slippage** (difference between decision price and execution price) – aim to minimize this; if it’s high, refine execution scheduling or algorithms.

* **RL Module KPIs:** Use **off-policy evaluation** techniques like Inverse Propensity Scoring or importance sampling to estimate how the RL policy would do if it had been deployed in past (while it’s still being tested). Ensure **safety violations \= 0**: check that the RL agent’s suggestions never led (or would lead) to breaching risk constraints – if it does, adjust its reward or constraints. Track the incremental gain from RL’s timing: e.g. compare performance of trades with RL vs if we executed them naively – the difference is RL’s contribution. If it’s not positive on average, refine the agent or consider different state features.

* **Regime Module KPIs:** Check **regime stability** – how often are we switching? If too often, we might be overreacting; the minimum dwell time logic might need to increase. We want regimes to be stable periods that meaningfully segment performance. Also test **predictive separation**: do different regimes actually correspond to different distributions of returns/volatility? They should. If not, the regime definitions may need overhaul. E.g., if the “low vol” regime doesn’t actually have lower volatility in realized terms, something’s off.

* **Intermarket Module KPIs:** Assess **lead-lag persistence** – if the module said bonds lead stocks by 3 days, did using that improve equity trading decisions? For example, if yields spiked and we cut equity exposure and equities then fell, that’s a win. Validate **Granger relationships out-of-sample** periodically – relationships can change, so update the universe of what macro factors are predictive.

* **Alt-Data Module KPIs:** Evaluate **nowcast accuracy** – compare the module’s alt-data based predictions (like sales or sentiment indices) to subsequent actual outcomes (earnings results, or moves). Compute error (MAE) and improve the models if needed. Also ensure alt signals aren’t too noisy: if trading purely on an alt-data spike yields no edge, maybe down-weight those.

Finally, institute a **continuous learning loop**: dedicate time (or an autonomous process) to retrain or recalibrate models using the above metrics. For example, monthly, take all the new data, retrain the sentiment model, update factor coefficients, retrain RL agent on recent experience, etc. Include *human analysts or developers in reviewing these metrics regularly* to catch any blind spots the system metrics miss. By systematically monitoring and improving each component, the system will remain at the cutting edge and adapt to new market conditions.

---

Together, the above steps for Version 1 create a fully autonomous, modular trading intelligence system where specialized **LLM-powered agents and models collaborate** via structured communication. This design echoes the latest multi-agent trading frameworks (with roles like analysts, risk managers, traders) that have shown superior performance over single-model approaches[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20138#:~:text=remains%20underexplored,reveal%20its%20superiority%20over%20baseline)[tradingagents-ai.github.io](https://tradingagents-ai.github.io/#:~:text=We%20presented%20TradingAgents%2C%20a%20multi,processing%20to%20further%20improve%20performance). The focus is on clear strategy execution: each doctrine item is implemented with concrete tools and integrated with others, yielding a cohesive whole greater than the sum of parts.

## **Version 2: Human-AI Hybrid Strategy (Collaborative Integration of Models & Humans)**

**Overview:** Version 2 presents an alternative action plan where the system’s sophisticated AI modules operate alongside **human experts** in a collaborative framework. The architecture includes the same components (Modules 0–13 and supporting systems) but emphasizes human oversight, validation, and insight at key junctures. This plan leverages autonomous LLM agents for data processing and preliminary decisions, while integrating human judgment for strategic guidance, exception handling, and continuous learning. The result is a **state-of-the-art human-AI team**, where LLMs handle speed and scale, and humans provide context, intuition, and final discretion on critical decisions. The strategy focuses on execution steps that ensure both **models and human analysts** contribute to the decision-making, aiming for the best of both worlds: automation efficiency with human wisdom as a safety net.

### **0\. Command & Control (Overseer \+ Regimes) – *Human-in-the-Loop Oversight & Regime Governance***

**Mandate:** Establish an **Overseer system** for strategy selection and signal fusion, similar to Version 1, but here the Overseer consists of an **AI overseer agent working under human supervision**. The human oversight committee (or lead strategist) collaborates with the AI to confirm regime changes and major allocation shifts.

* **Regime Deliberation:** The AI regime classifier proposes regime labels (using HMMs, Bayesian detectors as before), but a human analyst reviews these in periodic strategy meetings. For instance, if the AI signals a regime switch from “low-vol expansion” to “high-vol crisis,” the team examines macro conditions and external knowledge (maybe something the AI didn’t factor, like an upcoming election) to either confirm or adjust this classification. A human can override if needed, or at least require a higher confidence threshold if unsure. The Overseer interface will present evidence (market volatility up, correlations shifted, etc.) to humans for transparency.

* **Playbook Co-Creation:** Develop the strategy playbooks (for each regime) through human-expert input combined with AI backtesting. Humans (portfolio managers, quants) define broad strokes: e.g. “In a liquidity crisis, our priority is capital preservation: cut gross exposure by 50%, focus on quality assets.” The AI Overseer takes these guidelines and implements them quantitatively (adjust model weights, etc.). Whenever a regime shift is confirmed, the Overseer AI generates a proposed new allocation and risk posture per the playbook, which a human quickly reviews/approves. This ensures the playbook adaptation benefits from human domain knowledge (e.g. recognizing a regime is similar to 2008 and recalling qualitative lessons) as well as AI calculations.

* **Signal Fusion with Human Review:** The AI Overseer will still aggregate signals into policy proposals using weighting algorithms, but before execution, **human review is inserted for high-impact decisions**. For example, for any trade that would significantly change portfolio exposure (say \>2% NAV shift or a move that seems counter-intuitive), the system flags it for a human trader or risk officer to review in real-time. The human can ask the AI for rationale (“why do you want to buy 8% of this asset?”) – the Overseer should provide the reasoning and references to signals. This is facilitated by the AI producing a clear rationale list as in the JSON. The human can then either concur or intervene (e.g. “That rationale makes sense given today’s Fed announcement, proceed” or “The AI might be misreading this earnings report, let’s halve the position or wait a day”).

* **Veto and Escalation:** In this hybrid model, not only does the automated Risk module have veto power, but human overseers do as well. The doctrine of “Overseer can only escalate, never bypass” still holds: the AI Overseer cannot circumvent risk checks, and likewise if a human vetoes a trade due to qualitative concerns (maybe news that the AI didn’t parse correctly), the system must comply. Conversely, a human can escalate a concern (e.g. demand the system reduce exposure more than the AI proposed if they sense danger). All such human decisions are fed back into the learning loop so the AI can adjust (for instance, if humans consistently reject certain signals, the AI can learn to weight those less or seek more confirmation in future).

**How to Execute:** Set up a **dashboard or console** for the human overseer role. It should display current regime, key signals, proposed trades, and risk status in an easily digestible format. When the AI proposes an action, highlight anything unusual (big position, new asset, etc.) for human attention. Implement a workflow where a human can click “approve” or “reject/modify” on a proposed trade. Ensure there’s a fast communication loop (the market moves, so humans need to respond quickly; possibly integrate mobile alerts or a GUI with clear UI/UX). In practice, this might mean a designated human (or team on rotation) monitors during trading hours. They don’t intervene on every small trade (that would negate the automation), but they focus on outliers or regime changes. Over time, track which interventions humans make – are they adding value? If many human vetoes were unnecessary (the trades would have been fine), work on improving the AI; if they prevented issues, see if those can be codified into rules the AI can learn.

### **1\. Risk Management (Supreme Court) – *Human Risk Officer & AI Risk Engine in Tandem***

**Mandate:** Augment the AI-driven risk management with a **human risk officer or committee** that sets risk policy and reviews breaches. The AI handles real-time calculations and enforcement of hard limits; humans set those limits and review any override or borderline situations.

* **Human-Set Policy Limits:** Have humans (risk managers) define the initial risk limit parameters (VaR thresholds, max drawdown tolerance, leverage limits) based on their expertise and firm’s mandate. The AI risk engine then uses these to monitor exposure (as in Version 1). If the AI suggests changes (maybe it learns that the 99% VaR should be 3% instead of 2% given new volatility regime), it can recommend to the human risk officer to adjust limits. Humans periodically review and adjust these limits (e.g. in volatile times, they might tighten VaR limit proactively or instruct the AI to shift to a more conservative percentile).

* **Real-Time AI Monitoring & Human Alerts:** The AI risk module runs as before, flagging any breaches. But now, when a risk alert triggers (say potential VaR exceedance or a circuit-breaker threshold hit), it not only stops trades but also immediately notifies the human risk officer. The human can then investigate context: maybe the VaR spike is due to a temporary glitch or an unusual but acceptable scenario. The human can decide to **temporarily override** (for instance, allow a trade that slightly exceeds a limit if they judge the risk is manageable with other offsets), or enforce even stricter measures (tell the system to cut positions more). Such overrides are recorded.

* **Joint Decision on Extreme Events:** For severe situations (status “HALT” or “TIGHTEN”), the AI halts as coded, then defers to humans for next steps. For example, if portfolio drawdown hits 10% and kill-switch triggers, the system stops trading and informs humans. The human committee can then decide, after analyzing, whether to resume trading (and how – perhaps only hedging trades) or keep halted. The AI can offer suggestions (like “historically, when we hit such drawdown, a 30% reduction in exposure prevented further loss[tradingagents-ai.github.io](https://tradingagents-ai.github.io/#:~:text=Maximum%20Drawdown)”), but humans make the call. This collaborative approach ensures that during crises, experienced risk managers guide the response, using the AI’s data but also qualitative judgment (like considering liquidity conditions or news that models might not fully capture).

* **Transparency and Reporting:** Ensure the risk engine’s calculations are transparent to humans. Provide dashboards of VaR, ES, stress test results that humans can understand and even customize. The human risk team can commission additional scenario analyses on the fly via the AI (e.g. “AI, run a stress test assuming a 5% interest rate shock”), with results aiding their decisions. The AI effectively acts as an analyst for the risk team, quickly crunching numbers, but humans set the ultimate risk appetite.

**How to Execute:** Establish a **risk management console** for humans with real-time risk metrics and what-if tools. The AI risk module populates this console continuously. Develop an alerting system (emails, texts, etc.) for breaches so humans are immediately in the loop. Create simple interface for human risk overrides: e.g. a button or command to “allow exceeding limit X for Y period” which the AI will respect (with appropriate logging). Train the human team to interpret AI risk outputs and to trust but verify – e.g. if the AI says VaR is fine but humans suspect a hidden concentration risk, they can ask for deeper analysis. Regular (perhaps weekly) human risk meetings to review how actual risk vs model risk diverged, and adjust model parameters if needed. Essentially, treat the AI risk engine as a very sophisticated calculator and early warning system, with humans as the policy setters and judges for complex cases. This synergy should reduce chances of both automated blind spots and human errors (because AI catches what humans might miss in data, and humans catch what AI might miss in context).

### **2\. Sentiment Analysis (Narrative Field) – *AI-Generated Sentiment with Human Curation***

**Mandate:** Let the AI sentiment module perform large-scale scraping and sentiment scoring, but involve **human analysts** (e.g. experienced news editors or research analysts) to curate and interpret the narrative signals, especially for critical news.

* **Automated Sentiment Feed:** The system ingests news and social data and produces sentiment scores and narrative topics as in Version 1\. This feed of sentiment signals is made available on an internal dashboard. It might list top bullish and bearish stories of the day for each portfolio holding, along with the AI’s polarity and intensity rating.

* **Human Verification on Key Items:** For any **market-moving news** (e.g. a big earnings report, a major regulatory announcement) flagged by the AI, a human analyst double-checks the sentiment interpretation. The human reads the actual article or headline to confirm if the AI’s take (“strong positive, topic: product\_launch”) is reasonable. If the AI misinterpreted (maybe sarcasm or complex language confuses it), the human can correct the sentiment or nuance. This corrected info is fed back into the system (fine-tuning the NLP model over time, or at least adjusting that instance’s signal).

* **Contextual Judgment:** Humans add context that AI might miss: for instance, the AI might see a very negative article about a company, but a human knows that this issue is already widely known or expected by the market (so the impact might be muted). The human can annotate the sentiment signal with a note like “news already priced in” or reduce its effective weight. Conversely, an AI might underplay something because the language was mild, but a human recognizes it as a major strategic issue – they can override by boosting that signal. Essentially, humans act as editors of the narrative.

* **Crowd Sentiment vs. Smart Money:** Humans can also guide the differentiation between retail hype and substantively important sentiment. For example, a swarm of social media excitement (AI sees high euphoria) might be discounted if a human knows it's mostly speculative chatter. The policy could be: if sentiment is driven by low-tier sources and a human flags it, the Overseer will treat it cautiously. On the other hand, an op-ed by a respected industry figure might be given extra credence beyond what AI’s baseline model does (since AI might not inherently know who is influential).

* **Outputs:** The sentiment module output (after any human curation) becomes a refined sentiment signal feed that goes into the decision process. Humans might also produce a **daily narrative brief** – a short summary of “here’s the current market narrative” which the AI can incorporate into its context (somewhat like how a prompt’s context might include a human-written market summary to guide the AI). This combination ensures that raw AI sentiment scores are tempered with human common sense and domain knowledge.

**How to Execute:** Build a **news sentiment dashboard** where the AI posts its analyzed headlines, topics, and scores in real-time. Assign an analyst (or a rotation of them) to monitor this feed, especially during market hours. Provide an interface for the analyst to flag or adjust signals: e.g. click a thumbs-up/down or edit a score/topic. These adjustments then update the signal store that the Overseer reads. Implement feedback loop: store the human-adjusted vs original AI scores to later retrain the sentiment model (so it learns from those corrections, akin to a form of reinforcement learning from human feedback). Start with focusing on major news; as trust in AI grows, humans can step back to only exceptional cases. Also schedule a **daily meeting or report** where humans discuss notable sentiment findings with portfolio managers – this keeps human intuition in the loop of how narrative is driving the market, complementing the AI’s quantitative scores.

### **3\. Fundamentals Analysis (Anchor) – *AI Modeling with Human Analysts’ Expertise***

**Mandate:** Use AI to crunch numbers and generate valuation metrics, but incorporate **human equity analysts’ input** for assumptions and for interpreting fundamental signals, ensuring the intrinsic valuations make sense in context.

* **Collaborative Valuation Models:** Have the AI fundamental model produce its fair value estimates and factor scores, as in Version 1\. Then, involve sector-specific human analysts to **review and refine key assumptions**. For example, if the AI’s DCF assumes a generic growth rate for a tech company, a human tech analyst might say “Given recent product launch, revenue could grow faster next 2 years than model assumes.” They can tweak the input or provide a new scenario. The AI model can then recompute fair value with that input. In this way, each valuation becomes a collaborative exercise: AI ensures consistency and data processing, human ensures realism of assumptions.

* **Quality Flagging:** Human analysts can also set **qualitative flags** on certain stocks that the numbers alone don’t capture (e.g. “Accounting quality is questionable” or “Management has a history of sandbagging guidance”). These flags can be fed into the AI as additional features or directly influence the scoring (like a penalty to quality score if a human flag is negative). The combination yields a more robust fundamental assessment.

* **Focus on Outliers:** Let humans focus their attention where AI fundamental signals conflict with market pricing significantly (big mispricing score). For instance, if the AI says a stock is 50% undervalued but the market isn’t budging, a human analyst deep-dives: maybe there’s a hidden reason (legal risks, competitive threats) not in the model. The analyst might discover something and inform the AI (e.g. input an expected cost for a lawsuit settlement not in past financials). If nothing major is found, that human confidence could bolster conviction to trust the model – and maybe take a contrarian position.

* **Nowcasting with Human Intuition:** For alt-data integration into fundamentals (like sales nowcasts), humans with domain knowledge interpret those too. If satellite data shows store parking lots are full, the AI might forecast higher sales. A human retail analyst can confirm by anecdotal evidence or industry reports. This cross-verification helps avoid false positives (maybe lots of traffic but conversions are low – a human might know from experience). They then feed that insight back (like adjusting the nowcast or marking it uncertain).

* **Outputs:** The result is a set of fundamental signals (fair values, rankings, etc.) that have passed both algorithmic and human reasonableness checks. Additionally, humans might write a short **analyst commentary** for each company or sector periodically (e.g. “Stock X: AI sees undervalued due to low P/E, but watch out for debt load – manageable if rates stay low”). This commentary can be ingested by the LLM agents for context, ensuring the AI decisions “know” these human insights.

**How to Execute:** Use a **collaborative modeling platform** (like shared spreadsheets or a tool like Observable or a custom web app) where AI model outputs are visible and editable by humans. For each company, show the AI’s key assumptions and outputs; give humans sliders or input fields to test scenarios. Maintain a version control on assumptions so you know what humans changed. Encourage analysts to regularly update qualitative insights in a research note system; then use NLP to feed those into the AI’s knowledge base (or directly incorporate into prompts for the Overseer). Perhaps host a weekly fundamental review meeting: the AI presents a list of top 10 discrepancies (stocks most under/overvalued vs price), and analysts discuss each with the AI (possibly through a natural language interface). They decide which are real opportunities vs model quirks. This creates a loop where both human and AI learn: AI gets its models corrected or confirmed, humans get quantitative backing and broaden their coverage via AI.

### **4\. Technical Analysis (Path Geometry) – *Automated Charting with Human Trader Insight***

**Mandate:** Allow the AI to automatically generate technical signals and patterns, but incorporate **human traders’ market feel** for confirmation and to fine-tune parameters.

* **Automated Indicator Monitoring:** The AI technical module runs continuously, identifying trends, breakouts, mean reversion signals, etc. It can also generate visualizations like updated charts with trendlines, support/resistance levels, and annotate detected patterns. Provide these to human traders via a dashboard.

* **Trader Confirmation on Signals:** When the AI flags a strong technical signal (e.g. “Stock XYZ breakout above resistance with high confidence”), notify the human trader assigned to that asset/sector. The trader quickly looks at the chart and context – they might consider factors the AI doesn’t (maybe they know a breakout could be false because volume is low or it’s a known fake-out time). The trader can then either confirm the signal (allowing the system to act on it) or ask the system to hold off. This acts as a sanity check; experienced traders often have an intuition for which technical patterns are reliable in the current context (market sentiment, time of day, etc.).

* **Parameter Tuning with Human Feedback:** Over time, gather which technical signals traders often veto vs follow. If, say, the AI’s mean reversion calls in high-volatility regime are mostly vetoed by humans as too risky, adjust the model (maybe require more confirmation, or tune thresholds). If traders find the AI’s volatility estimates off, they can suggest adjustments (like, “the GARCH is underestimating – volatility regime changed faster than it caught up” and manually bump volatility input). This interplay ensures the technical model stays relevant and aligned with real trading tactics.

* **Microstructure and Execution:** Human execution traders can also feed their observations back: e.g., “We tried to execute the order AI recommended, but liquidity was worse than expected – technical module’s liquidity gauge needs recalibration for late-day trading.” This helps refine microstructure metrics. Also, if human traders spot patterns (like a certain algo or bot affecting prices daily at 3:30pm), they can tell the AI to incorporate a rule (like avoid trading at that minute or adjust signals around then).

* **Outputs:** Technical signals after human oversight remain similar (labels like bullish/bearish, breakout alerts), but possibly with a human confidence tag or slight modifications. Humans might sometimes generate their own discretionary technical insight and input it into the system (like “I see a head-and-shoulders top forming not detected by AI” – they could input a manual signal). The integration allows such human-generated signals to flow alongside AI ones to the Overseer.

**How to Execute:** Provide traders with a **real-time tech analyzer tool**. This could be a charting interface (perhaps integrated with TradingView or custom plot) where AI annotations appear. Next to it, give simple response options: “Confirm signal”, “Ignore this”, or “Delay”. Based on the click, the Overseer knows whether to act or not. If confirmed, it might go ahead to propose a trade; if ignored, maybe don’t trade on that signal; if delay, perhaps check again later or wait for second confirmation. Log these decisions. Periodically, a quant team reviews: if traders are often ignoring a certain indicator, maybe adjust or remove it; if confirming, maybe give it more automatic weight. This way the technical strategy evolves with human input. It’s important to train the traders and AI to trust each other: start with the AI in a suggestive role and humans in control; as confidence builds, humans might allow more auto-execution of certain proven signals, stepping in only when something feels off.

### **5\. Allocation of Resources (Capital & Compute) – *AI Optimization with Human Strategy Inputs***

**Mandate:** Use AI optimization to propose capital allocation, but let **human portfolio managers** adjust allocations based on qualitative strategy views or constraints not captured by the model. Similarly, manage compute resources with human oversight on research priorities.

* **AI-Proposed Portfolio vs. Human Overlay:** The AI allocation module (mean-variance, risk-parity etc.) outputs an optimal portfolio given the signals. Before execution, present this suggested allocation to the portfolio manager (PM) or investment committee. Humans review it for sanity and alignment with their convictions. For example, AI might suggest 30% in a single sector due to strong signals; a human PM might feel that’s too high due to unmodeled political risk or simply comfort level, and thus override to say “cap that sector at 20% for now.” They might also have insights like “We want to underweight this industry regardless of signals because we foresee regulatory issues” – they can tweak the allocation accordingly. The final allocation is thus the AI’s recommendation adjusted by humans’ high-level strategy directives. Over time, if humans consistently impose certain constraints, those can be added into the AI optimizer as additional formal constraints (the AI learns the human rules).

* **Turnover and Trade-Off Discussions:** When the AI suggests a big turnover (shifting many positions), a human can question if the benefit justifies costs. The AI can show expected gain vs est. transaction cost. If marginal, a human might say “let’s hold off on these minor reallocations”. On the other hand, if a human knows of an upcoming event (e.g. “we have a large cash withdrawal from the fund next month”), they may instruct the AI to keep more liquidity (which the AI wouldn’t know from data alone). Incorporate a communication channel for such human instructions so the AI can factor them (like a temporary constraint or adjusted objective).

* **Compute and Research Allocation with Human Direction:** The AI’s multi-armed bandit might identify which signals or strategies are promising, but humans can prioritize research based on intuition or external knowledge. For instance, if a PM suspects macro factors will be crucial next year, they might allocate more resources to improving the intermarket module, even if AI’s bandit didn’t yet realize its importance. Conversely, if humans feel a certain area is overhyped, they can ask to reduce compute on it. The idea is to not solely rely on automated metrics for R\&D direction – human foresight guides the AI’s exploration to some extent.

* **Outputs:** The outcome is an agreed-upon **target portfolio** that both AI and humans are comfortable with. Also, a **resource allocation plan** for the dev team or system: which models to refine, which data to collect more. This might be documented in a roadmap, influenced by the AI bandit’s suggestions but finalized by product managers/PMs. Essentially, humans ensure alignment with business goals and risk appetite beyond pure data-driven outputs.

**How to Execute:** Use a **portfolio visualization tool** where the AI’s optimal weights are shown alongside current weights. Humans can interact (drag sliders, input their desired changes). The tool can calculate in real-time how those changes impact projected risk/return, so humans see the trade-offs of their overrides. Make it easy to impose constraints like “set max X% on this sector” and re-optimize under that – the AI can do that recalculation quickly. Once humans are satisfied, that final set of weights goes to execution. Keep track of performance attribution: were the human overrides beneficial or not? If humans consistently detract (could happen if biases creep in), that might prompt recalibration or more trust in AI. For compute allocation, maintain a backlog of potential improvements. Have the AI bandit analysis as input (like a report: “these 3 signals gave best bang for buck recently”), but let humans in a research meeting decide where to invest time. Manage this like a project priority list, acknowledging both quantitative evidence and qualitative judgement (like regulatory changes might make a certain alt-data more important soon, etc.).

### **6\. Equity (Position) Management (Execution Law) – *Automated Execution with Trader Supervision***

**Mandate:** Allow the AI to handle routine execution tasks (slicing orders, etc.), but keep **human traders in the loop** to supervise executions, intervene in difficult market conditions, and maintain relationships with brokers/liquidity providers if needed.

* **Auto-Execution with Kill-Switch:** The system will send orders via algorithms (TWAP, VWAP, etc.) by default. A human execution trader monitors these in real time via an execution management system (EMS). If they see something off – e.g. the algorithm is executing too fast and moving the price, or an unexpected volume drought – they can hit a **kill-switch** to pause/cancel AI execution and take over manually. For instance, if a stock’s liquidity suddenly vanishes, a human might decide to wait rather than force the remaining order through. The AI’s execution algorithms should be tuned to typical conditions, but humans handle the abnormal conditions.

* **Broker and Venue Decisions:** Humans can guide *where* to execute. The AI might not have full knowledge of market microstructure beyond what it’s programmed. A human trader might say “Let’s route large orders through Dark Pool X because recently we get better fills there” or “Avoid Exchange Y today, it has system issues.” They input these preferences either through the system settings or manually direct part of the order. Over time, these preferences can be learned by AI (if we incorporate venue performance data into the execution model).

* **Position Monitoring:** Humans also watch the aggregate positions during execution. If multiple orders are executing, a trader ensures they don’t conflict or create an undesired aggregate exposure intra-day. For example, AI might be buying Stock A and selling Stock B separately, but a human notices both are highly correlated tech stocks – effectively the portfolio is getting a sector tilt intraday that might be risky if something happens before completion. A human might temporarily slow one leg to manage sector exposure. The AI could be improved to monitor that too, but human vigilance adds safety.

* **Learning from Human Adjustments:** All instances where humans intervene in execution should be logged. Later analysis by quants can identify patterns: e.g. “Human paused trading often at \~3:50pm in these volatile days – why? Maybe our execution model should automatically avoid the closing auction if volatility is high.” Incorporate these lessons so the AI gets smarter and requires less intervention in the future. Essentially, humans train the execution algorithms by demonstrating best practices in complex scenarios.

* **Outputs:** Ideally, even with human oversight, the execution module outputs the final execution report of trades (fills, prices). Humans might add notes like “paused at X due to news, resumed after 5min” for record-keeping. The system’s logs enriched with these human notes become a learning dataset.

**How to Execute:** Use an existing **Algorithmic Trading platform** integrated via API for order execution. Set rules for automatic pausing: e.g., if price moves more than Y% during our order execution, alert the trader. Give the trader a GUI showing all live orders and key metrics (fill %, avg price vs benchmark, etc.). Provide a big “Pause All” and “Pause \[specific\]” button. Also allow manual order entry, so if needed the trader can override AI by placing discretionary orders (like to quickly exit a position if something is wrong). Ensure the trader’s interventions feed back: have a field where they can categorize why they intervened (liquidity issue, news, algo bug, etc.). Aftermarket, review these. This requires close collaboration: the traders need to trust that the AI usually does the right thing so they can focus only on exceptions. Build that trust by gradually ramping up auto-exec: maybe start with small trades auto, large trades manual, then as AI proves itself, handle larger orders. Always maintain the manual override as a guarantee to the humans that they can correct the AI if needed (this psychological safety will make them more comfortable letting AI handle things).

### **7\. Scenarios & Stress Testing (Counterfactual Lab) – *AI Simulation with Human Scenario Design***

**Mandate:** Use AI to run routine scenario analyses, but involve **human risk managers and strategists** to design new scenarios and interpret results, ensuring the tests remain imaginative and relevant.

* **Regular Automated Stress Tests:** The AI system automatically runs the library of historical and synthetic scenarios (as described in Version 1\) and reports outcomes. Humans receive these reports perhaps weekly. The AI might highlight key vulnerabilities (e.g. “Portfolio would lose 8% if scenario X repeats”).

* **Human-Inspired Scenarios:** Humans add scenarios that the AI might not conceive from data alone. For instance, a risk manager might worry about a geopolitical event (e.g. “What if Taiwan conflict escalates?”) or a policy change (“What if the Fed unexpectedly hikes 100bps?”). These scenarios may not be in historical data in the same form. The human can sketch the scenario parameters (e.g. “Assume semiconductor stocks drop 20%, oil rises 15%, US yields up 50bps overnight”). The AI can then crunch how the portfolio fares. This way, human foresight and imagination extend the scenario coverage beyond the statistically generated ones.

* **Collaborative Analysis:** Once scenarios are run, human experts (risk, PMs) review the worst cases. They discuss with the AI: “Why is this position so hurt under scenario Y?” The AI can point to factors (like “Because it’s unhedged currency risk”). The team can then decide on mitigations (hedge or reduce that exposure). The outcome is a more robust portfolio. If a scenario is deemed high-risk and plausible by humans, they might direct the system to proactively adjust (even if AI signals haven’t yet). This is a conservative action humans might insist on (trading some performance for safety), which the AI will implement.

* **Adaptation:** Human oversight also ensures the scenario library stays up-to-date. As new kinds of events happen in the world, humans instruct adding them. And if certain scenario tests always show safe results and are no longer relevant, humans can remove or deprioritize them (to focus computing on more relevant ones).

* **Outputs:** The stress testing outputs remain as distributions and risk metrics, but now with human commentary. For example, a report might be annotated: “**Stress Test:** Liquidity Crisis scenario – AI projects 10% drawdown. **Human analysis:** Acceptable given low probability, but ensure credit hedge is in place. Action: increase cash by 5% as precaution.” These notes then feed back to changes in the portfolio or risk settings.

**How to Execute:** Schedule automated scenario runs (overnight perhaps). Then have a **scenario review meeting** with humans to go over results. Use visual tools: scenario P\&L graphs, tail risk contributions. Provide an interface for humans to input custom scenario parameters (maybe a simple form or even a natural language prompt to the AI: “Simulate scenario where XYZ happens”). The AI should translate that into shocks and run it. Maintaining a knowledge base of scenario rationales can be useful: e.g., document each scenario’s background (“Fed hike shock scenario added by J. Doe on 2025-08-01 due to rising inflation concern”). This documentation prevents duplicate scenarios and aids knowledge transfer. Empower humans to update scenario assumptions as needed (like if we hedge something, scenario outcome should change – ensure the AI re-calculates accordingly). By actively involving humans, scenario analysis becomes a creative, forward-looking exercise, not just a rote check-the-box.

### **8\. Reinforcement Learning (Policy Learner under Law) – *AI Learns from Human Strategies & Feedback***

**Mandate:** Train the RL agent with **human guidance and feedback**, ensuring it learns safe and effective policies. Use human expertise to shape its reward function and provide demonstrations of desired behavior.

* **Reward Shaping with Human Priorities:** Work with portfolio managers to encode what they care about into the RL reward. For instance, a PM might say “I care more about avoiding big losses than squeezing every drop of return”. So weight the risk penalty accordingly (maybe even more than AI would by pure data). If humans prefer smoother equity curves, reflect that. Essentially, ensure the reward function truly captures the human management’s utility, not just a theoretical one. This alignment will make the RL agent’s suggestions more acceptable and useful to the humans.

* **Human Demonstrations:** If there are historical records of trades by skilled human traders during various conditions, use these as a training set (imitation learning). If not, one could have experienced traders manually step through some simulated scenarios and “show” the AI what they would do. For example, have a veteran trader act in a simulation environment: when market does X, they do Y. Record this as state-action pairs. The RL agent can then be initialized or guided to mimic these actions (through behavioral cloning or as part of its loss function). This jump-starts learning in the right direction, and also encodes tactics that are second-nature to humans but would take the AI a long time to discover.

* **Human Feedback During Training:** Use techniques like Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). As the agent is being trained or tested, humans can watch some of its decisions and rate or comment on them. E.g., the agent might propose “sell everything at 3pm because volatility spiked” – a human may respond “that’s too reactive, minor spike, penalty”. Incorporate these judgments so the agent learns not just from numeric reward but also from direct critiques. One practical way: have the agent generate a batch of example action plans and have human experts rank them from best to worst; use this to train a preference model or directly adjust policy (as OpenAI did with InstructGPT, for instance).

* **Controlled Deployment:** Initially deploy the RL agent in a **decision support role**. It can suggest micro-timing moves, but human traders must approve as discussed. Over time, as it proves itself, trust is built. Possibly run A/B tests: sometimes follow RL suggestions, sometimes follow standard approach, and compare results – all under human monitoring. This careful rollout ensures the RL doesn’t cause unintended harm and that humans remain comfortable.

* **Continuous Learning:** Encourage a practice where after any significant market event, humans and AI review what happened. If the RL agent handled it poorly, the humans explain what the better approach was, and this becomes new training data. Conversely, if the RL did something clever the humans didn’t think of, analyze that and let humans learn or validate it was indeed good.

**How to Execute:** Develop a simulation environment as in Version 1, but enhance it with an **interactive interface** for humans. For imitation, you might simplify it: e.g., present historical scenarios and ask a human “What would you do at this point?” – record those actions. Use those as an initial policy via supervised learning. For RLHF, implement a feedback tool: e.g. show the agent’s policy or outcome for certain episodes and allow a human to give it a score or select preferred outcome from a few variations. Technically, incorporate this via something like deep reinforcement learning augmented with human feedback loop (could use an approach similar to training ChatGPT but for trading decisions). On deployment, integrate the RL agent’s output into the same oversight UI used by traders (maybe it’s an extra column: “RL suggests: wait 10 minutes” or “RL suggests: use limit order at $X”). Monitor performance and gradually increase autonomy only if it consistently performs and obeys constraints. Given the critical nature, always keep a way to easily fallback to purely rule-based execution if RL does something unexpected.

### **9\. Game Theory (Adversary Model) – *Human Market Insights Inform Adversary Modeling***

**Mandate:** Combine AI detection of adversarial patterns with **human traders’ market experience** to anticipate adversaries. Human intuition about competitors and market dynamics can greatly enhance the adversary models.

* **Human Intelligence on Opponents:** Portfolio managers and traders often have a sense of who the other big players are and what strategies they employ (e.g. “We suspect Hedge Fund X is doing a similar trade” or “Market maker Y often steps away during lunchtime, causing volatility”). Incorporate these insights by creating profiles in the adversary model. A human might literally tell the AI, “Assume there’s a high-frequency trader that pounces if we do X” – the AI can then simulate that scenario (like a game where if we execute too fast, an HFT jumps ahead). This goes beyond what AI might deduce from patterns; it’s using insider-like knowledge of market structure.

* **Manual Pattern Confirmation:** The AI can flag potential spoofing or manipulation patterns as before. Now, a human trader or compliance officer reviews those flags to confirm if they indeed look like manipulation. If confirmed, there might be regulatory steps (reporting to exchange) or strategy steps (avoid trading in that stock for a while). Humans might also input known historical manipulations so AI can look for similar patterns. Essentially, humans validate and enrich the adversary detection database.

* **Game Planning:** Use a collaborative approach to game theory: For significant trades, hold a quick strategy session (even if just a chat) between human traders and the AI. For example, if planning to exit a large position, the AI can propose “If we show our full size, market makers will widen spreads” and a human might add “Also, competitor fund might short if they sense us selling.” Together they decide on a stealth strategy (like splitting over days, using multiple brokers). The AI can then implement that strategy in execution. This way, the adversary module isn’t just automated – it’s an assistant in human brainstorming about strategy under adversarial conditions.

* **Learning from Encounters:** After any market incident where adversaries might have been at play (e.g. suspected someone front-ran our order or a rumor was strategically spread), do a post-mortem with humans and AI. Document what might have happened and update the adversary model assumptions. If, say, the team concludes “Yes, some entity was squeezing us”, then next time AI should anticipate that in similar conditions (maybe by holding a smaller position or using options instead of directly buying the stock). Humans can sanction precautionary measures that AI might be too data-driven to initiate on its own (since certain adversarial risks might be rare or never in training data, but humans can imagine them).

**How to Execute:** Create an **“adversary playbook” workshop** with traders and analysts. List known adversaries or patterns (like “momentum ignition algos”, “stop-loss hunting”, “predatory options order flow”). Encode simple models of these in the AI system (like rules or even small agent simulations). Then, whenever planning large trades or noticing anomalies, refer to this library. You might integrate a feature in the trade planning UI: a checklist “Adversary risks” that AI fills with possible concerns and humans tick off mitigations. Training the AI on historical order book data with known manipulations could improve its pattern recognition. But given manipulation is hard to label, human tagging of suspicious episodes is valuable. Over time, measure if adversary alerts or strategies reduced negative impacts (for example, our execution slippage improved after adopting certain stealth tactics – if so, that’s the payoff). Keep this as an evolving knowledge base, combining data and folklore of trading.

### **10\. Regime Recognition & Adaptation (Playbook Switchboard) – *Human-Informed Regime Definitions & Smooth Transitions***

**Mandate:** Develop regime adaptation with **human market strategists** contributing to the identification of regimes and transitions, ensuring the AI’s regime logic aligns with economic reality and not just statistical signals.

* **Defining Regimes Together:** Instead of solely clustering data to find regimes, involve economists or strategists to define what regimes make sense (bull market, bear market, stagnation, inflationary boom, etc.). Then use AI to map data to these definitions. For example, a human macro strategist might insist on an “inflation-driven regime” concept which the AI wouldn’t label purely from returns data. The AI can then include CPI trends in its regime features to identify when we’re in that regime. This yields regimes that are easier for humans to reason about and agree with.

* **Human Confirmation of Regime Change:** Similar to earlier description in Overseer, when AI signals a change, humans validate. But beyond validation, humans might predict regime changes *before* data fully confirms (based on qualitative leads). For instance, a human might say “We’re likely transitioning to a rising-rate regime soon because the Fed signaled tightening” even if market volatility hasn’t spiked yet. They can instruct the system to start shifting playbook preemptively (maybe partially). The AI can be programmed to allow such preemptive shifts with human command, rather than always lagging until data screams change.

* **Hysteresis & Dwell Tweaks:** Humans might adjust how sticky regimes are. If they believe the market is choppy but ultimately still bull, they might ask the AI to enforce a longer minimum bull regime dwell to avoid whipsaw on one bad week. Alternatively, if they sense rapid oscillation is real (like a news-driven jump then reversal environment), they might allow quicker regime toggles than normal. They essentially calibrate the adaptation speed based on context (e.g. during 2020 COVID crash, things changed so fast that typical hysteresis was too slow – a human override to switch regime faster would save losses).

* **Playbook Transition Oversight:** When a regime change happens, humans oversee the transition trades. The AI will shift allocations as per new regime, but a human PM ensures it’s done at a sensible pace (maybe gradually rotate over days to avoid transaction cost blow-up). They may also check if all modules updated properly (maybe the human ensures that, say, the sentiment model that works better in this regime is indeed being used). It’s like a pilot watching the autopilot during a course change – ready to grab controls if needed.

* **Outputs:** Same outputs (regime labels, etc.), but likely accompanied by a **regime change rationale report** that both AI and humans contribute to. For example: AI says “Vol and correlations jumped \-\> regime \= crisis” and human adds “Plus credit spreads widening and Fed emergency meeting \-\> confirm regime change.” This rationale can be logged and later reviewed to see if it was right. It helps in trust – everyone knows why the switch was made.

**How to Execute:** Formulate clear **regime definitions** in collaboration with experts: maybe a small set of core regimes with fundamental meaning. Configure the AI’s regime detection to target those (possibly via labeled data or semi-supervised learning where human-labeled historical periods guide the model). Build a regime monitoring dashboard: show current regime probability and factors. Humans should have a button or command like “force regime switch to X” or “increase sensitivity for regime Y for next month” – giving them high-level control if needed. Of course, these should be used sparingly, but existence of the option provides safety (e.g., in unprecedented times, human insight might outguess the AI temporarily). Evaluate afterward: if humans forced a switch and it proved wrong, maybe trust the model more next time, and vice versa. This synergy ensures the system is adaptive not just to numeric patterns but to the real-world context that humans might grasp first.

### **11\. Satellite Social Media & Web Traffic (Alt-Data Eyes) – *Alt-Data Analysis with Human Vetting of Sources***

**Mandate:** Use AI to gather and quantify alternative data signals, while relying on **humans to vet new data sources and confirm important signals**, preventing the system from chasing noise.

* **Source Selection by Humans:** There is a vast ocean of alt-data (social media, web traffic, etc.). Humans (data analysts or quants) should carefully choose which sources to trust and feed into the system. For example, decide to use Google Trends but not random small social media platforms, or use Twitter but filter for verified financial influencers. The AI can recommend sources (like “Reddit mentions have predictive power in backtest”), but humans must validate that the source is reliable and legal (data compliance) and not likely to be gamed. This avoids the AI picking up, say, some obscure forum chatter that could be brigaded or manipulated.

* **Human Cross-Verification of Alt Signals:** When the AI’s alt-data module flags a big attention spike (say a surge in Google searches for a product), have a human researcher cross-check context. They might search news around that time or check if it’s just a short-lived fad. If they confirm it’s meaningful (e.g. consistent with other data, or tied to a genuine trend), they greenlight the signal for use. If not, they might label it as a false alarm. This feedback trains the system’s anomaly detection to be sharper (learning what genuine vs false signals look like).

* **Integrating Domain Knowledge:** Humans provide understanding that AI might not infer: e.g., “Searches for ‘AMD’ spiked – but that’s because there was a popular video game called AMD released, not the stock.” Such nuance is crucial to avoid misinterpreting alt-data. The human can create a rule or note so that the AI doesn’t act on that kind of surge as bullish for the stock. Domain experts (maybe marketing or industry specialists) can be consulted to interpret weird data movements.

* **Periodic Review of Alt-Data Efficacy:** Humans periodically assess which alt indicators are actually adding value. If some aren’t, they can be dropped (preventing clutter and overfitting). They may also suggest new ones as industries evolve (maybe TikTok trends become relevant, etc.). The AI can do the heavy lifting of integration, but humans ensure the data remains relevant and legitimate.

* **Outputs:** Largely same as before, but likely with a **confidence tag** that might incorporate human vetting. For instance, an alt-data signal might come with “human\_verified: true/false”. The Overseer might use only or mostly those verified, or at least weight them higher. Unverified signals might be treated as tentative until a human looks, if they’re big enough.

**How to Execute:** Establish a **data governance** process. Every new alt-data feed goes through human approval. Maintain documentation of each source and its rationale. Create an internal wiki where analysts note context like “Google Trends for ‘EV charging’ – used as proxy for EV demand – correlates with X, but watch out during holiday seasons where it spikes due to unrelated reasons.” The AI alt-data processing pipeline can reference such notes (even ingest them as part of prompt/context if needed). Also, possibly maintain a small team or rotating duty for an analyst to daily/weekly check the top alt-data anomalies flagged by AI. Over time, as trust builds, humans might loosen checks on sources that prove consistently good (the AI can auto-use them unless something very unusual). But new or less reliable sources remain gated. Essentially treat alt-data signals somewhat like news signals – they may require a bit of human journalism to verify story versus noise.

### **12\. Cyclical Patterns & Seasonality (Temporal Skeleton) – *AI Baseline with Human Market Cycle Intuition***

**Mandate:** Use AI to capture statistical seasonality, and combine it with **human insights into business cycles and calendar events** to adjust the seasonal baseline.

* **Human Calendar Inputs:** Humans (especially those with long market experience or specific market domain knowledge) might know certain effects that data doesn’t fully capture because they’re rare or evolving. For instance, “Every U.S. election year, volatility spikes in Oct” or “After a pandemic, seasonal patterns might shift”. They can feed these expectations into the system. E.g., manually adjust seasonal baseline for an upcoming year if they expect a known event to distort it (“This year World Cup will shift retail sales seasonality in some countries”). The AI might not have a precedent for that, so human input is vital.

* **Business Cycle Consideration:** Seasonality module can be augmented by human economist input about the broader cycle. For example, in a recession, the usual seasonal uptick in consumer spending might be weaker. A human can signal the AI: “We’re in a downturn, dampen all seasonal bullish biases by 50%.” The AI then adjusts the seasonal signals accordingly. Without this, the AI using historical average might overestimate moves.

* **Review of Seasonal Model:** Humans should review the seasonal adjustments periodically. If the AI says “Stock X usually up 5% in January,” a human should sanity-check that with knowledge (maybe that was historically due to a factor that’s not present anymore). They either approve it or correct it (“Actually, that January effect was because of a tax law that changed last year, so it might not hold now”). The model can then be updated to reduce weight on that historical pattern.

* **Communication to Team:** Humans can also ensure that the rest of the team is aware of seasonal context. For instance, a portfolio manager might announce “We expect typical summer low volumes, so don’t be alarmed by less signals triggering” – aligning human expectations with model outputs. Conversely, the AI’s seasonal alerts can be supplemented with human commentary when communicating to stakeholders (e.g. explaining to an investment committee why the system is cutting risk into year-end – “the AI and we anticipate usual year-end rally risk, etc.”). This keeps trust and understanding high.

* **Outputs:** Seasonal outputs remain similar, but internal use might be moderated by human flags. For example, if a human flags a particular seasonal pattern as “not applicable this year”, the Overseer could ignore that pattern’s suggestion. A log of such overrides is kept to revisit whether it was right (if the pattern did or didn’t occur).

**How to Execute:** Incorporate a **seasonality review** in quarterly strategy meetings. AI presents upcoming seasonal effects and magnitude based on history. Humans discuss any expected deviations (macro conditions, one-off events). Adjust the seasonal profile for that quarter in the system via a simple config (like a factor to multiply or an on/off switch for certain patterns). For daily operations, ensure the seasonal adjustments are visible to traders and PMs so they know if something is just “expected norm” vs truly abnormal. If a human chooses to override or ignore a seasonal signal, have them log a brief note (“ignored holiday effect due to unusual news flow this year”). Use these notes to later see if the override was justified or if trusting the model would have been fine. This interplay keeps the seasonal framework flexible and tuned to real-world context that pure time-series analysis might miss.

### **13\. Intermarket Analysis (Macro Topology) – *AI Macro Signals Guided by Human Macro Expertise***

**Mandate:** Merge AI-driven cross-asset analytics with **human macro strategists’ perspectives**. Let the AI quantify relations, but humans will interpret macro cause-effect and incorporate external macro knowledge (policy, geopolitics) that models may not directly include.

* **Human Macro Hypotheses:** Macro strategists can propose hypotheses for the AI to test. For example, “I suspect oil price moves will lead airline stocks with 1-month lag in this regime.” The AI can then compute that correlation/lag and report back. This guides the AI to explore specific relationships that humans think are relevant, rather than blindly scanning everything. It’s a way to inject economic theory or intuition (like yield curve inversion impact) into the AI’s process.

* **Economic Event Integration:** The AI’s correlation/Granger tests are statistical. Humans add interpretation and forward-looking event info. For example, humans know a Fed meeting is next week – they can tell the system “Be aware: interest rate likely changing.” The AI might not treat that as a given because historically it’s just one random event among many. But a human can force a scenario in the macro analysis: “If rate \+0.5%, then equity likely \-X%” to pre-position. Similarly, if geopolitical risk is rising (war probability, etc.), humans ensure the macro module accounts for it (maybe by widening expected volatility on certain commodities or FX beyond what historical correlation would suggest).

* **Hedge Strategy Approval:** When the macro module suggests hedges (short this or buy that), a human PM or risk officer reviews those suggestions. They consider practical aspects: maybe the suggested hedge instrument is illiquid or too costly. They might choose an alternative (AI says short junk bonds via an index, human says do puts on S\&P instead, because it’s more liquid but still correlates to economic downturn). The AI can learn this substitution if repeated. Also, a human might decide not to hedge if they have a strong discretionary view that the risk won’t materialize (taking responsibility consciously).

* **Global Context:** If the system mostly focuses on certain markets (say US), a human strategist might incorporate global macro context: “Even though our system sees nothing wrong domestically, there’s a crisis in emerging markets that could spill over.” They inform the macro module to monitor certain global indices or incorporate a risk-off bias. The AI could then adjust cross-asset signals (maybe treat all risk assets with more caution). Without human input, the AI might only pick this up after correlations spike.

* **Outputs:** Macro signals (pressure scores, etc.) with a layer of human commentary. Possibly a daily macro briefing generated by the AI and edited by a human, summarizing key cross-asset moves and what the system is doing about them. This ensures the PM team is on the same page with the AI’s macro stance, and humans can easily correct any misreads.

**How to Execute:** Have regular **macro strategy check-ins** (maybe weekly calls) where the AI presents its intermarket findings (like “bonds leading stocks, etc.”) and humans add their forward view (“We expect ECB to do something, which could break that pattern”). Use tools for humans to adjust macro assumptions: e.g., input an expected shock or change into the system (like manually set “next month, assume \+1% interest rate” and see output). Equip the macro module to take in “exogenous inputs” (like a planned policy change) that it normally wouldn’t know until after the fact. Training the AI with macroeconomic data and linking to events can help, but direct human input on upcoming events is simpler and more reliable. Encourage macro experts to regularly read the AI’s output and give feedback if something seems economically nonsensical (like if AI finds a spurious correlation – humans can spot it and mark it “likely spurious, ignore unless persists”). Over time, integrate these as filters (the system might learn to discard correlations that don’t make economic sense unless confirmed strongly).

### **14\. Behavioral Econ**

### **Integration & Communication Protocol – *Human-Friendly Information Exchange***

In the human-AI hybrid model, communication protocols not only need to facilitate module interactions (as in Version 1\) but also ensure **humans are kept in the loop and can intervene**. We still use structured JSON/object communications under the hood, but we add layers for human readability and interaction.

* **Transparent Logging:** Every signal and decision in structured form is also logged in a human-readable format (e.g. a dashboard line: “\[10:05\] Sentiment signal for AAPL: \+0.7 (bullish, high confidence) from news about record earnings”). This logging helps humans quickly grasp what the AI is “thinking”. It should be organized by time and importance, with the ability to drill down (perhaps clicking shows the JSON details and rationale). Essentially, the black box is made as transparent as possible, so humans feel comfortable and can audit any strange output.

* **Human Override Channels:** Extend the communication protocol to accept **human-initiated signals or commands**. For example, a human might input a manual risk flag (`{"target":"Portfolio","status":"TIGHTEN","reason":"policy_uncertainty"}`) that the Risk module will treat just like its own signal, causing tightening of limits. Or a human could send a policy proposal (like “hedge 5% via gold” in structured form) into the system, which the Overseer then evaluates with risk like any AI proposal. Provide interfaces (like forms or quick command buttons) for humans to send such structured inputs without needing to code JSON. This ensures the system can seamlessly integrate human decisions as if they were another module.

* **AI Explanations in Natural Language:** While inter-module comms remain structured, whenever a human is reviewing or asked to approve something, provide a succinct **natural language explanation** generated by an LLM based on the structured rationale. For instance, alongside the JSON proposal, show: “Proposal: Buy \+8% VNINDEX over next 2 days. Rationale: undervalued vs fundamentals, momentum positive, sentiment tailwind. All risk checks OK.” This is easier for a human to quickly digest than raw JSON fields. The explanation is derived from the fields `rationale` and `constraints_checked` etc., which the system can template or have an LLM agent format.

* **Citations and Traceability:** When humans want to investigate further, they should be able to trace any data point back to source. For example, if a human sees a sentiment score and is unsure why, they can click to see the actual news headlines or social posts that contributed (with highlights). If the fundamental module says fair value $100, the human can see the assumptions. This traceability builds trust. The system can use the `explain` fields and link to source data (like an ID for a news article) to enable this. The focus is making sure the structured communication doesn’t become a wall – it’s the skeleton, and humans can query more details through UI that the AI populates.

* **Feedback Loop:** The protocol should incorporate a way to capture human feedback. As discussed, if a human overrides or corrects something, that should enter the system’s data. For instance, if human changes a sentiment interpretation, perhaps a message goes to a “feedback channel” that the sentiment model training process picks up. This could be a special structured message like `{"family":"sentiment","feedback":"overstated_positive","reference_signal_id":"sig_123"}` etc. Over time, the AI uses this to adjust. Similarly, if a human approves a risky trade that AI would not have (taking responsibility), log that – maybe next time AI will ask or incorporate that context (“my human is okay with a bit more risk in this scenario”). These design elements ensure the AI isn’t just monologuing at humans; it’s a dialogue.

**How to Execute:** Develop a unified **human-AI interaction platform** (could be web-based) that sits on top of all module communications. It subscribes to the message bus and renders info nicely. Use colored alerts, summaries, and tooltips linking to details. For input, provide forms/buttons for common overrides (e.g. “Override regime”, “Adjust risk”, “Manual trade” etc.), which the backend converts to the appropriate structured message that goes into the system. Use the LLM to generate human-facing summaries of complex JSON when needed (it’s fine if the LLM is just a helper for UI, since final actions are still checked by risk module structurally). Regularly get feedback from the human users of the interface – if they find any part confusing or not getting enough info, adjust what the AI provides. The goal is an **explainable AI cockpit** where the human operators feel in control and informed, with AI doing heavy lifting in the background.

### **Context Management & Memory – *Shared Knowledge Base Between Humans and AI***

In the hybrid model, context management must serve both AI and human team members. This means maintaining a knowledge repository that both can draw from, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding recent events, decisions, and rationale.

* **Shared Synopsis & Reports:** The system’s rolling synopses and summaries (as in Version 1\) should be accessible to humans as well. Perhaps the AI generates a daily or weekly summary (one that it also uses to keep context) and distributes it to the team. This way, humans know what the AI has “seen” as important. Likewise, if humans add context (like “the CEO resignation rumor is false per our channel”), that note should be logged such that the AI context includes it. Essentially, build a **joint knowledge base** where key facts, recent events, and conclusions are stored, tagged by entity/date. Both AI prompts and human reference material come from this single source of truth (with appropriate interfaces).

* **Top-K Relevance with Human Curation:** The retrieval system for AI (top-K chunks) can also be used by humans via a search UI. If a human PM wants to know “What does the system know about XYZ sector right now?”, they can query the knowledge base and see the same summary the AI would use. Humans might spot if something’s missing or outdated and can add a note or import some research. The context manager then includes that new info for future AI queries. This keeps the context fresh and comprehensive, leveraging human inputs.

* **Limit Context to Avoid Info Overload:** Both AI and humans can get overwhelmed by too much data. The context manager should filter to keep things concise. Humans can set preferences: e.g., “Don’t include more than one page of text for any single news item” or “Prioritize context from last 1 month”. The AI can follow similar rules. If the context is exceeding limits, maybe a human can manually summarize further or instruct the AI on what to drop (like “we don’t need that old stuff now”). This collaboration ensures the context window is optimized.

* **Persistent Memory for Decisions:** Keep a log of decisions and the context used, accessible for later. If months later someone asks “Why did we make that big shift in May?”, the system should retrieve the May context and rationale (both AI signals and any human notes). This helps institutional memory for the team and can feed into learning (maybe retrain models on those situations). The LLM agent can also use it: e.g., the next time similar conditions arise, it might recall “Last time in such a regime we did X, which worked/failed”. Humans reviewing a proposal might also appreciate seeing “similar scenario occurred N months ago, outcome was Y” as provided by the AI memory.

**How to Execute:** Use a combination of a **vector database** for embedding-based retrieval and a **wiki-style database** for structured info and human notes. Set up processes where at end of each day or week, the AI auto-summarizes key developments and decisions, and humans can edit that summary for accuracy or emphasis. That goes into the knowledge base. Provide a search tool to query this knowledge. Possibly integrate with chat – e.g., a human could ask an assistant bot “Why did the system do X yesterday?” and it would gather context to answer (this leverages the LLM with the knowledge base). The same assistant can answer questions for AI modules that need historical context. Regularly prune and archive old info to keep the working context lean, but not lose it if needed for long-term reference. This fosters a true partnership memory: not just the AI’s context window, but the team’s collective memory, maintained by both.

### **Guardrails & Safety Checks – *Human Supervision as Ultimate Guardrail***

In the hybrid plan, guardrails include all the automated checks from Version 1, plus **human oversight as an additional safety layer**.

* **Automated Guardrails as First Line:** Continue to enforce all schema validations, limit checks, and anomaly detections algorithmically. The human should rarely see those, because the AI should catch and correct issues before escalating. However, when something does go out-of-bounds or contradictory and automated guardrails trigger a halt, immediately notify humans. They then act as the final decision-makers on how to resolve the issue (fix input data, override a model, etc.).

* **Human Review of AI Outputs:** For sensitive outputs (like final trade decisions, especially large ones), require a human sign-off as a guardrail until a high level of confidence is reached. This was discussed: e.g. above a certain trade size, human must approve. This is a policy guardrail. Over time, if AI proves it can handle certain size, the threshold might increase. But the idea is any action that could be catastrophic if wrong goes through at least one human glance.

* **Contradiction and Sanity Checks with Human Logic:** Sometimes AI modules might output things that pass numeric checks but fail common sense. Humans provide another filter: e.g., if AI somehow suggests going 100% cash in a normal situation (maybe an overreaction), a human PM would question it – “Is this really necessary? Did the AI misread something?” They can demand a re-check or simply veto if convinced it’s an error. Humans can catch multi-module contradictions too: maybe no single module raises an alarm but a human notices a puzzle (“We’re heavily long and short on very correlated assets, what’s the point?”) and then adjust. Creating a culture where team members challenge the AI and vice versa leads to more robust outcomes.

* **Procedural Compliance:** Ensure the AI’s actions comply with any external rules (regulatory, client mandates). Humans in compliance roles oversee this. For example, AI might inadvertently propose a trade that violates an investment mandate (like buying something not allowed). Automated rules should catch many such cases, but humans double-check compliance reports. If something slips, they intervene. They also might impose new rules for compliance that the AI then has to include in its guardrails.

* **Post-Mortems and Updates:** Every time a guardrail (auto or human) prevents a potential issue or fails to prevent one, do a joint review. If a human saved the day by catching something, figure out if the AI can be updated to catch that next time. If a human missed and only auto-guardrails or luck prevented a disaster, train the team and maybe tighten rules. The safety system thus continuously improves, with both machine and human learning from near-misses.

**How to Execute:** Set clear **escalation protocols**. For example: if an automated check triggers, halt the process and page the on-duty human immediately. Maintain a runbook that humans follow in such cases (like check data sources, reconvene modules, etc.). Use a tracking system for guardrail incidents (like JIRA tickets or a spreadsheet) to ensure each gets analyzed and resolved, not just patched over. In team meetings, regularly review these incidents to reinforce a culture of safety. Also simulate failure scenarios (fire-drills): e.g., deliberately feed bad data and see if guardrails and humans catch it in a test environment, to validate readiness. The combination of robust code checks and engaged human oversight forms a multi-layer defense (like Swiss cheese model of risk – many layers so holes don’t align).

### **Evaluation & Continuous Improvement – *Human Oversight in Performance Review***

The evaluation in the hybrid model includes all the metric tracking from Version 1, with **humans deeply involved in interpreting and acting on these metrics**. Continuous improvement becomes a collaborative exercise.

* **Joint KPI Review:** Regularly (monthly or quarterly), have a review meeting where the AI presents its performance metrics (perhaps through dashboards) for each module, and humans discuss them. For example, AI shows “Sentiment signal correlation to returns \= 0.2 last quarter, down from 0.3”. The humans can hypothesize why (maybe news regime changed, or need model update). Together, decide on adjustments: retrain model, or maybe the drop is due to fewer events and is fine. Humans will also add qualitative context to metrics (e.g., “Our RL agent had low added value because the market was range-bound, not because it’s broken”). This ensures metrics aren’t interpreted blindly; the team forms a narrative around them, leading to targeted actions.

* **Human Performance Feedback:** Not only evaluate the AI, but also how humans interfaced. Did humans override often? Were those good moves? For instance, track “human override success rate” – if humans overrode 5 trades and 4 would have been worse without override, good. If not, maybe humans were too cautious. This introspection can lead to adjusting training or guidelines (maybe trust AI more in some cases, or train AI to accommodate the human insight it missed).

* **Continuous Learning with Human Data:** Use the logged human adjustments as additional training data. E.g., retrain the sentiment model on cases humans relabeled, incorporate human-approved trades as examples for RL agent, etc. If new patterns emerged that humans caught (like a new macro relationship), include that in data/features for next model iteration. Essentially, human interventions are gold mines of information for improving AI, so systematically include them in retraining datasets or model updates.

* **Stay Updated with Research:** Have humans (quant researchers) keep an eye on external developments (new algorithms, new data sources). They can then guide upgrading modules. For example, if a better volatility model is published, they can test it and incorporate if good. The AI won’t automatically know about new research; humans ensure the system remains state-of-the-art. The human team and AI together iterate the system design (maybe adding a new module or merging some if needed).

* **Adaptive Goals:** The team can set goals for the AI system that evolve (like reduce false alarms by X%, improve Sharpe by Y). Use metrics to track these. If some goals consistently miss, humans decide whether to invest effort to improve that area or accept that it’s inherently noisy. For instance, if adversary detection rarely finds anything but cost time, maybe scale it down if it’s not worth it, or vice versa. This managerial touch ensures resources (both human and compute) are optimally allocated for improvement.

**How to Execute:** Create a **scorecard** for each module and overall. The AI can populate it with numbers, and humans can add commentary. Use version control or a wiki for these quarterly reports to see progress over time. Assign owners (maybe each module has a human champion) who will be responsible for looking into its performance issues. Encourage an open culture where the AI is treated somewhat like a team member – its “performance” is reviewed, and plans are made for training (like you’d plan for an employee’s professional development\!). Leverage the mix: sometimes the fix is data or coding (AI side), sometimes it’s training humans or adjusting process (human side). The result is an ever-improving socio-technical system, learning from both model errors and human errors to refine itself.

In summary, **Version 2** leverages a partnership approach: autonomous **LLM agents handle data-heavy, fast-response tasks**, while **human experts guide strategic decisions, oversight, and insight integration**. The action plan ensures every doctrine component benefits from automation **and** human judgment. This results in a resilient system: the AI provides scale and precision, and humans provide context and ethical/prudential oversight. By focusing on how to implement each piece and integrate them with human workflows, Version 2 delivers a cutting-edge yet pragmatic blueprint for the Hitherto platform – one that is *autonomous* and *self-learning* but still aligned with human intelligence and intent at every step.

Building Time:

Agent 0 databases:

## **0\) Conventions that keep you sane**

* **IDs:** ULID or BIGINT surrogate keys; all tables get `id`, `created_at timestamptz`, `asof timestamptz` where relevant.  
* **Time:** always `timestamptz`; store market sessions explicitly (`session_date date`, `session_id text`).  
* **JSONB fields:** for rationale, parameter blobs, and forward-compatible config.  
* **Partitions & indexes:** time-partition large histories by month; composite indexes on `(asset_id, asof)` or `(session_date, regime)`.  
* **Enums:** `regime_type`, `verdict_status`, `proposal_status`, `human_action`, `limit_kind`.

## **A) `core` — regimes, playbooks, proposals, decisions**

1. **`core.regime_state`** — history of detected/declared regimes.  
   * Keys: `id`, `asof`, `regime regime_type`, `confidence real`, `hysteresis_lock_until timestamptz`, `source text` (e.g., “HMM”, “Human”).  
   * Why: single source of truth for “what regime are we in right now?” with dwell/lock semantics.  
2. **`core.playbook`** — versioned mapping from regime to weights/constraints.  
   * Keys: `id`, `version int`, `is_active bool`, `valid_from/valid_to`, `name text`, `notes text`.  
   * Payload: `weights jsonb` (module→weight), `thresholds jsonb`, `tiers jsonb` (human-review triggers), `horizons jsonb`.  
   * Why: hot-swappable configuration, not code.  
3. **`core.policy_proposal`** — output of Agent 0 fusion per cycle.  
   * Keys: `id`, `asof`, `regime_state_id fk`, `playbook_id fk`, `status proposal_status`(DRAFT|UNDER\_REVIEW|APPROVED|REJECTED).  
   * Payload: `targets jsonb` (desired exposures/alloc deltas), `rationale jsonb` (top drivers, feature deltas), `metrics jsonb` (expected risk/return).  
   * Why: the “what we want to do” object.  
4. **`core.decision`** — final, executable intent derived from an approved proposal.  
   * Keys: `id`, `proposal_id fk`, `asof`, `decider text` (“AUTO|HUMAN|RISK-DOWNGRADE”), `notes`.  
   * Payload: `orders jsonb` (instrument, qty, side, urgency), `constraints_checked jsonb`.  
   * Why: downstream execution reads only this.  
5. **`core.asset`** & **`core.portfolio_snapshot`** — needed for feasibility and guardrails.  
   * `asset`: static dims (symbol, venue, currency, lot\_size).  
   * `portfolio_snapshot`: `asof`, `positions jsonb`, `cash numeric`, `gross_exposure`, `net_exposure`.  
   * Why: proposals must reference a real, current book.
